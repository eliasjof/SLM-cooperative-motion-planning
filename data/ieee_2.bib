  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for surveillance and monitoring to complete target search tasks. However, the short battery life and moderate computational capability hinder UAVs to process computation-intensive tasks. The emerging edge computing technologies can alleviate this problem by offloading tasks to the ground edge servers. How to evaluate the search process so as to make optimal offloading decisions and make optimal flying trajectories represent fundamental research challenges. In this paper, we propose to utilize the concept of uncertainty to evaluate the search process, which reflects the reliability of the target search results. Thereafter, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to jointly make optimal computation offloading decisions and flying orientation choices for multi-UAV cooperative target search. Specifically, we first formulate an uncertainty minimization problem based on the established system model. By introducing a reward function, we prove that the uncertainty minimization problem is equivalent to a reward maximization problem, which is further analyzed by a Markov decision process (MDP). To obtain the optimal task offloading decisions and flying orientation choices, a deep Q-network (DQN) based DRL architecture with a separated Q-network is then proposed. Finally, extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and comprehensive discussions on how different parameters affect the search performance are given.},

  abstract={The use of unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) for timely and efficient disaster inspection is an important measure to reduce earthquake losses. Aiming at the problem that complicated terrain of the disaster area and the urgent time of disaster relief, this paper puts forward a multi-UAV collaborative disaster inspection search method, gets the optimal scheme of inspection under the primary disaster and secondary disaster. Factors such as terrain, inspection time, search area coverage and number of drones are fully taken into account, and the multi-machine cooperative flight model under primary disaster and secondary disaster is established respectively. Combined with the fastest descent method and the A Star algorithm, a route plan is obtained to complete the maximum coverage search in a specified time with UAV. The whole area search route under secondary disaster is obtained by using taboo search algorithm. The simulation results show that the route is reasonable and the maneuverability is strong.},

  abstract={The flexibility and controllable mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) render them easier to become aerial platforms carrying out integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) functionality, and the cooperation among multiple UAVs is a promising way to achieve simultaneous multi-static radar sensing and coordinated multiple point (CoMP) transmission, leading to an enhanced ISAC service. However, due to the intrinsically limited resources that UAVs can utilize, it is challenging to achieve performance improvement for dual purposes. Toward this end, in this paper, an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) UAV-enabled ISAC system is investigated, and a joint trajectory planning and resource allocation problem is formulated to minimize the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for target location estimation while guaranteeing the communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to solve in general, and we first decompose the original problem into three sub-problems and then propose the corresponding algorithms to obtain the optimal solutions efficiently. The extensive simulations demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the performance improvement on the localization with different communication requirements compared to conventional techniques.},

  abstract={When multiple UAVs carry out multiple data ferry tasks with inconsistent deadlines at the same time, aiming at the problem of large volume of tasks and limited number of UAVs, the "One Wave" collaborative task allocation mode leads to low task completion rate and low utilization rate of UAVs, a "Multi-wave" task allocation method based on task urgency is proposed. In this task allocation mode, the UAV group performs specific tasks according to the task set divided by each wave, A UAV belongs to one or more task sets. Each wave adopts the scheduling strategy of FCFS (First Come First Service) to reuse UAVs. UAV groups cooperate in the same wave, while independent of each other between different waves. By determining the UAV scheduling strategy and iterating different wave intervals, in order to improve the task completion result, an improved genetic algorithm based on UAV multiplexing is used to solve the problem. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional "One-Wave" task allocation method, the proposed "Multi-Wave" task allocation method RTDA (Reused Task Distribution Algorithm) improves the completion of tasks by 112% and the average utilization of UAVs by 31.32% under the optimal wave interval.},

  abstract={As the emerging technology of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) becomes mature, UAVs are widely used in environmental monitoring, communication and other fields. In view of this, this paper analyzed the task of synergistic multi-UAVs exploration of unknown environments, and proposed a path planning method for them based on reinforcement learning. Firstly, the path planning task of the UAVs was divided into two parts: the path travel strategy module and the information exploration strategy module. Models of the two modules were based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG), and an improved Artificial Potential Field (APF) force traction mechanism was introduced in the path travel strategy module. Its aim was to assist in guiding the generation of UAV flight path trajectories. Also it could enhance the learning capability of the model. The path travel strategy module would generate the complete flight path of the whole cluster in a distributed manner. A series of temporary target points provided by the information exploration strategy module helped. In maps with 21.5%, 25.3% and 29.6% of obstacles, multi-UAVs could achieve 84.2%, 76.7% and 69.9% of environmental exploration by the designed method. Compared with the APF method, the A star method and the Breath First Search (BFS) method, the proposed method is not only able to plan feasible paths in a more complex map model, but also the curvature of the planned paths is smoother, thus achieving the goal of reducing the energy cost of UAVs.},

  abstract={This paper presents a decentralized method to the problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) cooperative search of an unknown area. Firstly, based on search map model, the multiple UAVs cooperative search problem is posed as a receding horizon (RH) optimization decision problem, and a RH based UAV search decision process is proposed. Then, this centralized online optimization problem is partitioned into several UAV subsystems optimization problems and solved in a parallel manner using a Nash optimality based decentralized RH optimization method, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for subsystem optimization. Next, by introducing the heuristic information and improving the extension of node, a modified rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) based path planning algorithm is presented to the UAV search path planning. It is shown by simulation that the proposed method can reduce the size of multiple UAVs optimization decision problem, and lead to an efficient cooperative search for multiple UAVs.},

  abstract={Manned aerial vehicle (MAV)/ Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative system will be a significant form of aerial engagement in future. Based on convex optimization theory, a trajectory planning method for the cooperative system is proposed. Firstly, the motion model of the system was established and the controlling process was analyzed. Secondly, trajectory planners of MAV and UAV were designed, where the minimum energy consumption and the shortest time to arrival were selected as optimization objective respectively. Then the model of the two planners was approximated and convexified, with the spatial-temporal constraints. After that, the convex optimization algorithm was used to solve the problem. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified by taking the dual aerial vehicle as a scenario. The results show that the convex optimization algorithm can solve the optimal model of the trajectory planners effectively, and the safety of the cooperative system can be guaranteed by adding the spatial-temporal constraints.},

  year={2021},
  volume={2},
  number={},
  pages={1000-1014},
  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of scheduling transmissions for spatially scattered nodes that contribute to a collaborative federated learning (FL) algorithm via wireless links provided by a drone. In the considered system, the drone acts as an orchestrator, coordinating the transmissions and the learning schedule within a predefined deadline. The actual schedule is reflected in a planned path: as the drone traverses it, it controls the distance and thereby the data rate to each node. Hence, the model is structured such that the drone orchestrator uses the path (trajectory) as its only tool to achieve fairness in terms of learning staleness, which reflects the learning time discrepancy among the nodes. Using the number of learning epochs performed at each learner as a performance indicator, we combine the average number of epochs computed and staleness into a balanced optimization criterion that is agnostic to the underlying FL implementation. We consider two methods for solving the complex trajectory planning optimization problem for static nodes: (1) successive convex programming (SCP) and (2) deep reinforcement learning (RL). Considering the proposed criterion, both methods are compared in three specific scenarios with few nodes. The results show that drone-orchestrated FL outperforms an immobile deployment by providing improvements in the range of 57% to 87.7%. Additionally, RL-guided trajectories are generally superior to SCP provided ones for complex node arrangements.},

  title={Balancing search and target response in cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) teams}, 
  year={2006},
  volume={36},
  number={3},
  pages={571-587},
  abstract={This paper considers a heterogeneous team of cooperating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) drawn from several distinct classes and engaged in a search and action mission over a spatially extended battlefield with targets of several types. During the mission, the UAVs seek to confirm and verifiably destroy suspected targets and discover, confirm, and verifiably destroy unknown targets. The locations of some (or all) targets are unknown a priori, requiring them to be located using cooperative search. In addition, the tasks to be performed at each target location by the team of cooperative UAVs need to be coordinated. The tasks must, therefore, be allocated to UAVs in real time as they arise, while ensuring that appropriate vehicles are assigned to each task. Each class of UAVs has its own sensing and attack capabilities, so the need for appropriate assignment is paramount. In this paper, an extensive dynamic model that captures the stochastic nature of the cooperative search and task assignment problems is developed, and algorithms for achieving a high level of performance are designed. The paper focuses on investigating the value of predictive task assignment as a function of the number of unknown targets and number of UAVs. In particular, it is shown that there is a tradeoff between search and task response in the context of prediction. Based on the results, a hybrid algorithm for switching the use of prediction is proposed, which balances the search and task response. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract={This paper concerns the multi-UAV cooperative path planning problem, which is solved by multi-objective optimization and by an adaptive evolutionary multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm (AEMO-EDA). Since the traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms tend to fall into local optimum solutions when dealing with optimization problems in three dimensions, we suggest an advanced estimation of distribution algorithm. The main idea of this algorithm is to integrate the adaptive deflation of the selection rate, adaptive evolution of the covariance matrix, comprehensive evaluation of individual convergence and diversity, and reference point-based non-dominated ranking. A multi-UAV path planning model involving multi-objective optimization is established, and the designed algorithm is simulated and compared with other three high-dimensional multi-objective optimization algorithms. The results show that the AEMO-EDA proposed in this paper has stronger convergence and wider population distribution diversity in applying to the multi-UAV cooperative path planning model, as well as better global convergence. The algorithm can provide an stable path for each UAV and promote the intelligent operation of the UAV system.},

  abstract={Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (Multi-UAV) cooperative area search is an important and effective means of intelligence acquisition and disaster rescue. Search path planning is a critical factor to improve multi-UAV search performance. Aiming at the search inefficiency resulting from insufficient cooperation between UAVs in existing researches, we present a novel distributed real-time search path planning method based on distributed model predictive control (DMPC) framework. Firstly, we formulate the overall search objective function in finite time domain, considering not only repeated searches, but also maintenance of connectivity and collision avoidance between UAVs. Secondly, we decompose the overall search objective function to establish a distributed constrained optimization problem (DCOP) model, so that all UAVs optimize the overall search objective by interacting with neighbors. Thirdly, aiming at the problem of falling into the local optima in existing algorithms, distributed stochastic algorithm based on enhanced genetic algorithm (DSA-EGA) is proposed to solve the established DCOP model. We design a point crossover operator and introduce anytime local search (ALS) framework that stores the global optimal solution explored. Finally, the simulation results of different benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed DSA-EGA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the quality of solution. The simulation results of cooperative area search problems illustrate that the established DCOP model improves the search efficiency by 7.7%, and DSA-EGA improves the search efficiency by 4.3% at least. In addition, we also verify that our method has high scalability.},

  abstract={Operating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments can be challenging, particularly for inexperienced operators. This paper introduces a method aimed at enhancing the piloting experience by incorporating an intermediary processing layer between the remote controller and the drone. The presented approach empowers operators to control both the speed and direction of the UAV along a secure path, which is continuously computed and overlaid onto the operator's camera stream. The UAV autonomously plans and executes this path, adapting to the operator's commands and en-vironmental changes. The primary aim of this proposed solution is to enhance the operator's situational awareness, perception, as well as the safety and efficiency of UAV navigation. The paper outlines the system and methodology employed, showing its ability to operate at a high enough frequency to enable seamless user interactions. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of this approach, a real-world test and a user-based experimental study conducted in a simulation environment with an audience comprising varying levels of pilot expertise have been carried out.},

  abstract={Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) technology is essential for safety operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The Artificial Potential Field (APF) method, which is widely used in robot path planning domain, have advantages of low computational cost and fast calculation ability. However basic APF method may lead the UAV to the “repulsive dilemma”. Considering each UAV as their obstacles, we use APF method for UAV's collision avoidance and provide a priority allocation rules and exempt mechanism based on geometry for high-efficiency cooperative conflict resolution, especially in uncertain communication circumstance. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we set three cases of experiment and introduce the “clone airspace” inspired by the concept of cell in chemistry sphere for improving the simulation performance. Using the proposed CD&R method, the result shows a decrease of more than 46% of possible Near Mid-Air Collision (NMAC) with high safety and efficiency.},

  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in reconnaissance missions due to their good maneuverability, low cost and high efficiency. When multiple UAVs complete reconnaissance tasks, they need accurate positioning and cooperation. In the case that some UAVs lack positioning equipment, cooperative reconnaissance of UAV groups in a certain spatial area can be realized. The innovation of this research lies in the proposal of a novel combinatorial metaheuristic optimization method, named Combinatorial Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (CM RFO). This method uniquely combines the Hungarian algorithm from combinatorial optimization with the manta ray foraging optimization from metaheuristic optimization to systematically address collaborative task planning problems for multiple UAVs. According to the requirements of the cooperative reconnaissance task, a model is established that is divided into three stages: estimation of the optimal reconnaissance position of the UAV, estimation of the position of the UAV itself and reconnaissance subtask assignment. In the experiment, through the optimization results of particle swarm optimization, the Harris eagle algorithm and Manta ray foraging optimization in position estimation, the superiority of the Manta ray foraging optimization algorithm is demonstrated, and the Hungarian algorithm is then used to obtain the optimal distribution results of reconnaissance subtasks. We also show the completion process of the multi UAV cooperative reconnaissance task in some scenes where UAVs lack positioning equipment through graphical simulation and verify the proposed multiple unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative reconnaissance model},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) coordinated path planning and intercommunication for visual exploration of a geographical region has recently become crucial. Multiple UAVs cover larger area than a single UAV and eliminate blind spots. To improve the surveillance, survivability and quality of the communication, we propose two algorithms for the route planning of UAV cluster operated in obstacle rich environment: (i) Multiple Population Genetic Algorithm (MPGA) (ii) Relay Selection Criteria (RSC). The main objective of MPGA is to minimize the total mission time while maintaining an optimal distance for communication between the neighboring nodes. MPGA utilizes evolutionary speciation techniques with a novel Feasible Population Creation Method (FPCM) and enhanced Inter-species Crossover Mechanism (ISCM) to obtain diversified routes in remarkably short time. In obtaining collision-free optimum paths, UAVs are subjected to constraints such as limited communication range, maximum maneuverability and fuel capacity. In addition to the path planning, RSC is developed for selection of UAVs relay nodes that is based on the location of the relay relative to source and destination. It is crucial since the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of the link significantly depends on the location of the selected relay. In this paper, path planning and relay allocation algorithms are combined to have a seamless high quality monitoring of the region and to provide superior Quality of Service (QoS) for audio-video applications. Also, simulations in different operation zones with a cluster of up to six UAVs are performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithms both in optimality and computation time.},

  abstract={Due to the flexibility and agility, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising way for gathering data generated by wireless sensor networks. However, the limited battery capacity of the UAV restricts its application on many occasions, e.g., the networks deployed in the wild. In this paper, we propose a cooperative trajectory planning scheme to deal with the energy issue of the UAV, where a truck carrying backup batteries moves along with the UAV acting as a &#x201C;mobile recharging station&#x201D;. Our optimization task is to minimize the total mission time for gathering data from all the sensor nodes, which can be achieved by solving two problems: First, we need to divide the entire mission area into multiple subregions so that the UAV can hover over each subregion to collect the data of the sensor nodes through just one taking-off and landing under the constraint of battery capacity; second, we should find out the optimal trajectory of the truck so that the UAV can get to the hovering positions of each subregion from the truck and fly back to it before the battery drains considering the road condition in real world. We introduce an efficient clustering algorithm to partition the area into subregions in a load-balanced way to minimize the number of movements of the UAV. The trajectory planning task is formulated as a coordinated traveling salesman problem, which is solved by a three-step trajectory planning algorithm heuristically, and we also give the analysis of the upper bound and lower bound to demonstrate the performance guarantee. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme provides an effective and cost-efficient way for the data collection of large-scale wireless sensor networks in practical scenarios.},

  abstract={The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various domains by enabling seamless connectivity and real-time data exchange between connected IoT devices. However, in sparse deployment scenarios where sensor nodes (SNs) are sparsely distributed, ensuring low data delivery latency becomes a significant challenge. Our research aims to address this issue by utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support IoT networks. In the existing UAV-aided IoT systems, all UAVs are required to return to the base station (BS) to deliver data, which results in significant data delivery latency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a collaborative data acquisition model that uses air-to-air data relay between UAVs. By leveraging the mobility and agility of UAVs, the proposed system facilitates efficient data relay between SNs and the BS. To further optimize the performance of the system, we present a time-balancing scheduling data acquisition (TSDA) scheme. This scheme combines a centripetal-based relay pairing method for UAVs to achieve seamless data relay and a joint scheduling scheme to minimize the hovering time during data delivery. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed TSDA scheme can achieve lower data delivery latency in sparse deployment scenarios compared to existing data acquisition schemes. In addition, the joint scheduling scheme can significantly reduce the hovering time of UAVs so that the collaborative relaying advantage can be better exploited.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={The maturity in autonomous navigation of Un-manned Aerial Vehicles (UAV s) provides the possibility to deploy UAV s for different kinds of inspection jobs. Aircraft inspection is a well-known periodic process in aviation history, which is long, costly, and subjective. Manual inspection usually takes several hours, where multiple sensors on the aircraft's outer surface, dents, lightning strikes, paint, etc. are mainly checked. The main advantage of a UAV-based inspection is to minimize the turnaround time, which reduces the cost. Deployment of multiple collaborative UAVs is a must because most of the off-the-shelf UAVs do not have endurance for more than 30 minutes. There exist multiple challenges, e.g., safety of the multi-million dollar aircraft while multiple UAV s navigate, accurate identification of defects in the millimeter range, accurate localization of the defect on the aircraft body surface, etc. Moreover, the solution should be independent of the aircraft model and scalable for any model with minimal effort. To this end, we present a visual inspection system for aircraft using collaborative autonomous UAV s that is auto-adaptable to any aircraft model with minimal manual intervention. The system allows each UAV to start from any random location in the vicinity of the aircraft and uses a novel registration algorithm to collaborate between them and navigate using LiDAR-Inertial measurements. The navigation algorithm creates multilayered zones for safe navigation and to avoid obstacles. The system uses a low-cost RGB-D camera for inspection and detects defects. To the best of our knowledge, there is no open data for such a task, and given the limitations in creating it with a real aircraft, we evaluate our proposed system in a Gazebo simulation with an anonymous aircraft model. The proposed approach is able to complete the inspection task within 10 minutes using two UAVs.},

  abstract={Monitoring pollution plumes is a key issue, given the harmful effects they cause. The dynamic of these plumes, which may be important due to meteorological conditions, makes their study difficult. Real-time monitoring in order to obtain an accurate mapping of the pollution dispersion is helpful and valuable to mitigate risks. In this work, we consider a fleet of cooperative drones carrying pollution sensors and operating in order to assess a pollution plume. The latter is assumed to follow a Gaussian process (GP) with varying parameters. For this use case, we propose an efficient approach to characterize spatially and temporarily the plume while optimizing the path planning of drones. In our approach, drones are guided by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model called the categorical deep  $Q$ -network (Categorical DQN) to maximize the plume coverage while considering budget constraints. Specifically, we develop a scalable independent  $Q$ -learning (IQL) scheme that shares team rewards based on each drone’s deployment relevance and, therefore, ensures cooperation. We evaluate the performance of the plume parameter estimation as well as the maps generated by the GP regression. By testing our framework on several plume scenarios, we show that it offers good results in terms of both estimation quality and runtime efficiency.},

Based on the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method, the algorithm optimizes the attractive potential field function and the repulsive potential field function. Besides, this paper adds both a priority collision avoidance strategy between UAVs and temporary virtual target strategy. This algorithm not only improves the success rate of path planning, but also considers the collision problem when multiple UAVs cooperate to complete the task. The experimental simulation results show that, compared with the traditional APF method, the algorithm can accurately and effectively complete the path planning task in the complex obstacle environment, and realize the collaborative path planning of multi- UAV formations at the same time.},

  abstract={Due to its flexibility and complementarity, the multi-UAVs system is well adapted to complex and cramped workspaces, with great application potential in the search and rescue (SAR) and indoor goods delivery fields. However, safe and effective path planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the cramped environment is always challenging: conflicts with each other are frequent because of high-density flight paths, collision probability increases because of space constraints, and the search space increases significantly, including time scale, 3D scale and model scale. Thus, this paper proposes a hierarchical collaborative planning framework with a conflict avoidance module at the high level and a path generation module at the low level. The enhanced conflict-base search (ECBS) in our framework is improved to handle the conflicts in the global path planning and avoid the occurrence of local deadlock. And both the collision and kinematic models of UAVs are considered to improve path smoothness and flight safety. Moreover, we specifically designed and published the cramped environment test set containing various unique obstacles to evaluating our framework performance thoroughly. Experiments are carried out relying on Rviz, with multiple flight missions: random, opposite, and staggered, which showed that the proposed method can generate smooth cooperative paths without conflict for at least 60 UAVs in a few minutes. The benchmark and source code are released in https://github.com/inin-xingtian/multi-UAVs-path-planner.},

The mission-level guidance and control of UAVs often depend on an accurate map and inaccurate maps may lead to the UAV's inappropriate accommodation to the environment. In this paper, we propose a new framework to generate and utilize semantic map information, which we defined as risk factors for cooperative UAVs. First, we generate a high-precision panorama as a global map by mosaicking a bird's-eye atlas. Afterward, we build a semantic map based on a neural network. Finally, we utilize the semantic information-enhanced map to guide the path-planning functions.

In the near future, the cooperation of multiple UAVs is expected to play more and more important role in emerging applications. However, existing UAV control platforms are lack of good support for cooperative tasks. For example, they control multiple UAVs in a leader-follower model instead of in a more cooperative way. As a result, research teams have to build their own platforms manually from sketch to implement a specific multi-UAV application. In this paper, to facilitate the development of multi-UAV applications, we propose a general control and monitoring platform for cooperative UAV fleet, namely, CoUAS, which provides a set of cooperative services including synchronization, connectivity management, energy simulation, etc. To evaluate the proposed platform, we then implement a prototype and run a designed path planning algorithm on it.

  abstract={This study proposed the development plan of a novel aerial-to-ground remote sensing (AGRS) system for surveying the land scenes of interest. Specifically, the AGRS system is composed by integrating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging system and a mobile mapping system (MMS), onboard whose platform a control station is also added. The UAV-MMS-collaboration can be classified into two modes - loosely and tightly, respectively related to two efficacy levels of the AGRS - fine-scale mapping in general and target investigating in special cases. The latter scenario can be illustrated by the tasks of fast-responses to the time-critical events, e.g., seeking the accessible roads into disaster areas. These all pose challenging issues. To ensure the premise for AGRS development, a field test was carried out in prior to examine the collaborative effect between its two RS-functional modules. Two typical topics were explored, i.e., self-indicated orthorectification of the UAV images and landcover classification based on information fusion. The final positive results have basically validated the feasibility of the development of the AGRS system.},

  abstract={The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology is opening up new opportunities in the integrated space-air-ground in the 5G era and beyond. However, providing low-latency services solely from an overall perspective cannot ensure a high quality of experience (QoE) for user equipments (UEs). Therefore, we propose a service experience-oriented cooperative caching framework, where the UAVs can effectively serve each UE by providing communication and computing resources. A novel metric called service experience ratio is defined to reflect the experience at the UEs. Under the constraints of UAV's energy budget and delay requirements, we consider jointly optimizing task offloading, resource allocation, trajectory planning, and service caching placement to maximize the service experience ratio. Since the original problem is a mixed-integer non-convex programming problem with a fractional structure, it is challenging to be solved in polynomial time. Based on Dinkelbach's method and convex optimization theory, we simplify the problem model and propose a four-stage alternating iterative service ratio maximization algorithm to solve this problem. Besides, we also analyze the convergence and complexity of our proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the service experience ratio achieved by the proposed algorithm is 19–34% higher than the comparative works.},

  abstract={This paper presents a new swarm intelligence-based approach to deal with the cooperative path planning problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is essential for the automatic inspection of infrastructure. The approach uses a 3D model of the structure to generate viewpoints for the UAVs. The calculation of the viewpoints considers the constraints related to the UAV formation model, camera parameters, and requirements for data post-processing. The viewpoints are then used as input to formulate the path planning as an extended traveling salesman problem and the definition of a new cost function. Ant colony optimization is finally used to solve the problem to yield optimal inspection paths. Experiments with 3D models of real structures have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that our system is not only capable of generating feasible inspection paths for UAVs but also reducing the path length by 29.47% for complex structures when compared with another heuristic approach.

  volume={8},
  number={11},
  pages={7249-7256},
  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must fly at low altitudes to execute certain missions when operating in complex mountainous areas. However, in these environments, UAVs lose their line-of-sight (LOS) communication with the ground station (GS) due to the obstruction of the mountains and are unable to retransmit information such as video, which will lead to mission failure or affect the flight safety of UAVs. To address this difficulty, this study proposes a cooperative planning method for heterogeneous UAVs by ensuring steady communication based on the shortest total mission time. To accomplish this goal, a relay UAV is positioned to enable indirect but constant LOS connectivity between the mission UAV and the GS. Specifically, to alleviate data storage pressure, a terrain lightweight modeling method is employed. In addition, a new LOS judgment model that constructs communication relay LOS links between communication nodes for complex mountain environments is presented. This study considers different types of UAVs; for the fixed-wing UAV, the minimum turning radius constraints are taken into account to plan a flyable trajectory. The problem is formulated as the multi-step optimization model that accounts for communication constraints, obstacle and collision avoidance, and the performance constraints of heterogeneous UAVs to plan the trajectories of the mission UAV and relay UAV in order to maintain LOS links between the mission UAV and the ground station. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and ensures the completion of cooperative exploration missions for heterogeneous UAVs in complex mountain environments.},

  abstract={Recently, more and more researchers have used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the UAV local path planning problem. However, existing DRL didn’t consider the importance of recent experience for path planning, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO). Moreover, the Actor-Critic framework of PPO suffers from the problem of high variance. To address the above issues, we proposed a Delayed-policy-update PPO with a Prioritized Reply of Recent experience (DPPO-PR2) for local path planning. Firstly, we designed an adaptive parameter to calculate the probability of resampling. By limiting the range of resampling, the possibility of resampling the recent experience is increased. Secondly, a parameter experimentally is picked to make the Actor Network have fewer updates than the Critic Network. Finally, we verified our algorithm has better convergence results and faster execution in six test scenarios.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) have become a new paradigm for on-demand and intelligent marine monitoring. To enable diverse AI applications, numerous computation-intensive tasks (e.g., image recognition, video processing, path planning, etc.) that cannot be locally executed by UAVs need to be timely and effectively offloaded. Multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) integrated into a USV fleet is appealingly advocated to provide abundant computation resources for computation tasks. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient USV fleets-assisted collaborative computation offloading scheme for smart maritime services. Specifically, we first propose a collaborative computation offloading framework, where UAVs act as the requesters of computation offloading services, and USV fleets are the helpers. Then, the first-price sealed reverse auction with reserve price is utilized to incentivize USV fleets to assist in executing computation tasks of UAVs, where the reserve price guarantees the satisfied benefits of UAVs. Afterwards, to minimize the energy consumption of executing tasks within the USV fleet under the delay constraint, the joint allocation optimization scheme for computation subtasks and computation capacities is proposed based on the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the expected revenue and participation degree of the USV fleet and reduces the overall energy consumption of computation offloading compared to conventional schemes.},

  abstract={In the realm of IoT-enabled surveillance systems, drones play a pivotal role in detecting and tracking suspects within defined areas. However, a significant challenge arises when a single drone identifies multiple suspects concurrently, leading to the inability to effectively track all targets simultaneously. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a collaborative algorithm designed to enhance multi-target surveillance and tracking in such environments. The algorithm fosters cooperation among drones by dynamically selecting suitable assisting drones to engage in the tracking process. When a drone identifies multiple suspects, it transmits relevant information, including positional data and imagery, to the base station. Subsequently, the algorithm orchestrates the assignment of new tracking missions to assisting drones, enabling them to effectively follow the additional targets. This paper elucidates the algorithm’s intricate workings, elucidates its integration within the IoT-based surveillance system architecture, and presents the empirical results of its implementation. Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the algorithm’s efficacy in improving tracking accuracy, mission success rate, and resource utilization. The proposed solution holds the potential to revolutionize multi-target tracking capabilities in IoT-driven surveillance scenarios, offering a tangible advancement in collaborative drone operations.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communications has emerged as a promising technology in many domains, such as disaster relief and emergency scenarios. However, the limited battery capacity restricts UAVs from performing such persistent missions. In this paper, we consider a general hybrid trajectory planning problem to efficiently provide emergency communications in time-constrained disaster-affected regions, where a ground vehicle carrying backup batteries moves along with the UAV as a “mobile charging platform” to handle the energy issue of the UAV. Our optimization task is to minimize the total cost of the mission. We show that the optimization task is an extension of the traveling salesman problem with soft time window constraints. Due to the NP-hardness of the task, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning with a sequential model strategy to learn the policy for the UAV's visiting order, based on which the collaborative routes of the UAV and ground vehicle are designed. Numerical results show that our proposed learning-based route planning scheme is effective and efficient.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel cooperative system for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) which utilizes the UAV not only as a flying sensor but also as a tether attachment device. Two robots are connected with a tether, allowing the UAV to anchor the tether to a structure located at the top of a steep terrain, impossible to reach for UGVs. Thus, enhancing the poor traversability of the UGV by not only providing a wider range of scanning and mapping from the air, but also by allowing the UGV to climb steep terrains with the winding of the tether. In addition, we present an autonomous framework for the collaborative navigation and tether attachment in an unknown environment. The UAV employs visual inertial navigation with 3D voxel mapping and obstacle avoidance planning. The UGV makes use of the voxel map and generates an elevation map to execute path planning based on a traversability analysis. Furthermore, we compared the pros and cons of possible methods for the tether anchoring from multiple points of view. To increase the probability of successful anchoring, we evaluated the anchoring strategy with an experiment. Finally, the feasibility and capability of our proposed system were demonstrated by an autonomous mission experiment in the field with an obstacle and a cliff.},

  abstract={In the multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, the cooperative computation among multiple UAVs can improve the overall computation service capability. Multi-UAV MEC systems can meet the quality of service requirements for computation intensive applications of ground terminals (GTs) in complex field environments, emergency disaster relief and other special scenarios. In this paper, a multi-UAV cooperative computation framework is proposed while taking the GT movement and random arrival of computation tasks into consideration. A long-term optimization problem is formulated for the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and resource allocation, subject to minimizing the total GT computation task completion time and the total system energy consumption. To solve this problem, a joint multiple time-scale optimization algorithm is proposed. In particular, the optimization problem is decomposed into a long time-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning subproblem and a short time-scale resource allocation subproblem. The proximal policy optimization algorithm is invoked to solve the long time-scale subproblem. The greedy algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method are employed to solve the short time-scale subproblem. Finally, a joint multiple time-scale optimization algorithm with a two-layer loop structure is proposed. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed multi-UAV cooperative computation MEC system outperforms the conventional MEC system without collaboration among UAVs; and 2) the proposed algorithm can quickly adapt to different degrees of environmental dynamics and outperforms the benchmark algorithm for different network sizes, task requirements, and available resources.},

  abstract={The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for target searching in complex environments has increased considerably in recent years. The numerous studies on UAV search methods have been reported, but few have been conducted on collaborative human-UAV search which is common in many applications. In this paper, we present a problem of collaborative human-UAV search for escaped criminals, the aim of which is to minimize the expected time of capture rather than detection. We show that our problem is much more complex than the problem of pure UAV search. The difficulty of our problem is further increased by the fact that criminals will attempt to avoid detection and capture. To solve the problem, we propose a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (EA) that uses three evolutionary operators, namely, comprehensive learning, variable mutation, and local search, to efficiently explore the solution space. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some well-known EAs and other popular UAV search methods on test instances. An application of our method to a real-world operation took 311 min to capture a criminal who had escaped for over three days, validating its practicability and performance advantage. This paper provides a good basis for promoting the application of EAs to a wider class of man-machine collaboration scheduling problems.},

  abstract={The purpose of this tutorial paper is to present an application example for the MultiUAV cooperative control simulation. MultiUAV has been used to simulate a cooperative moving target engagement (CMTE) scenario, with a team of UAVs acting as a sensor and communication network to cooperatively track and attack moving ground targets. This scenario illustrates the utility of MultiUAV for cooperative control applications requiring heterogeneous vehicles with varied sensor, communication, dynamic, and weapon capabilities. A human supervisor designates one or more moving ground targets for the vehicles to attack. The vehicle agents must then autonomously and cooperatively determine which vehicles perform the required tasks, when the tasks are performed, and what flight paths are used. This requires assigning time-dependent cooperative and joint tasks, where multiple sub-elements of the primary task must be accomplished by different vehicles, for any of the tasks to have value. This paper focuses on the unique requirements of the CMTE scenario and how they are addressed in the MultiUAV simulation.},

  abstract={The domain of UAV-assisted Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) emerges as a novel frontier, characterized by the seamless integration of edge computing capabilities with UAV to facilitate advanced computational services for Terminal Devices (TDs). This research tackles two critical aspects in UAV-assisted MEC frameworks: the strategic formulation of UAV flight paths and the refinement of execution latency for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tasks. We introduce an innovative solution employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), coined as the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for UAV Trajectory Planning and Task Offloading (TD3-TT) algorithm. This algorithm harmonizes UAV flight planning, DAG task delegation, and scheduling hierarchies, thereby enabling UAV to efficiently undertake task offloading and processing concurrently along their designated optimal trajectories. Through this approach, the latency within the computational network is significantly diminished. A thorough examination of simulation outcomes reveals that the TD3-TT algorithm exhibits notable convergence and robustness, surpassing conventional benchmarks and markedly reducing the execution latency of DAG tasks.},

  pages={2637-2656},
  abstract={A receding-horizon cooperative search algorithm is presented that jointly optimizes routes and sensor orientations for a team of autonomous agents searching for a mobile target in a closed and bounded region. By sampling this region at locations with high target probability at each time step, we reduce the continuous search problem to a sequence of optimizations on a finite, dynamically updated graph whose vertices represent waypoints for the searchers and whose edges indicate potential connections between the waypoints. Paths are computed on this graph using a receding-horizon approach, in which the horizon is a fixed number of graph vertices. To facilitate a fair comparison between paths of varying length on nonuniform graphs, the optimization criterion measures the probability of finding the target per unit travel time. Using this algorithm, we show that the team discovers the target in finite time with probability one. Simulations verify that this algorithm makes effective use of agents and outperforms previously proposed search algorithms. We have successfully hardware tested this algorithm in two small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with gimbaled video cameras.},

  pages={108034-108045},
  abstract={This paper presents new cooperative path planning algorithms for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using Game theory-based particle swarm optimization (GPSO). First, the formation path planning is formulated into the minimization of a cost function that incorporates multiple objectives and constraints for each UAV. A framework based on game theory is then developed to cast the minimization into the problem of finding a Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium. Next, hierarchical particle swarm optimization algorithms are developed to obtain the global optimal solution. Simulation results show that the GPSO algorithm can generate efficient and feasible flight paths for multiple UAVs, outperforming other path planning methods in terms of convergence rate and flexibility. The formation can adjust its geometrical shape to accommodate a working environment. Experimental tests on a group of three UAVs confirm the advantages of the proposed approach for a practical application.},

  abstract={Multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance for target search, localization, and tracking has attracted much attention in both civil and military applications, where strategies need to be designed for UAVs to finish the reconnaissance task cooperatively and in the time optimal manner. Different from the state-of-the-art of recent research where all the UAVs involved are equipped with homogeneous payloads, this work exploits payload diversity to enhance the time efficiency of the cooperation and proposes a fast multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance (FMUCR) method. FMUCR groups UAVs in pairs. In each pair, one UAV is equipped with a passive positioning radar, referred to as p-UAV, while another is equipped with an active positioning radar, referred to as a-UAV. FMUCR exploits the large detection range and rough target location detection of passive radar to enable fast search and directional tracking of a target, while the precise target position calculation of active radar to enable accurate tracking of a target. Specifically, the task area is partitioned into subareas according to the number of UAV pairs. Each UAV pair conducts target search, localization, and tracking in one subarea, where the p-UAV leads searching and preliminary tracking of targets, while accurate tracking of targets are taken over by the a-UAV. Algorithms for off-line path planning and on-line path planning are designed, respectively, for target search and target tracking. The comparative simulation demonstrates that, FMUCR can greatly shorten the target discovery time with little loss in target tracking accuracy.},

  abstract={Cooperative search-attack is an important application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm in military field. The coupling between path planning and task allocation, the heterogeneity of UAVs, and the dynamic nature of task environment greatly increase the complexity and difficulty of the UAV swarm cooperative search-attack mission planning problem. Inspired by the collaborative hunting behavior of wolf pack, a distributed self-organizing method for UAV swarm search-attack mission planning is proposed. First, to solve the multi-target search problem in unknown environments, a wolf scouting behavior-inspired cooperative search algorithm for UAV swarm is designed. Second, a distributed self-organizing task allocation algorithm for UAV swarm cooperative attacking of targets is proposed by analyzing the flexible labor division behavior of wolves. By abstracting the UAV as a simple artificial wolf agent, the flexible motion planning and group task coordinating for UAV swarm can be realized by self-organizing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a set of simulation experiments, the stability and scalability are evaluated, and the integrated solution for the coupled path planning and task allocation problems for the UAV swarm cooperative search-attack task can be well performed.},

  abstract={Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are suitable for complex missions in denied environments. In scenarios where denial is potentially hostile, the use of stealth approaches is essential, as it allows such missions to be conducted in the proximity of threatening radars and weapons. We propose a model that allows autonomous UAVs to dynamically and cooperatively reduce their exposure to threats by adopting a stealth policy, in which they turn off their communication radios once a threat is detected. We named this approach of cooperative model as Stealth UAV Networks (SUN). Our model also encompasses control laws for connectivity maintenance, collision avoidance between UAVs, flight path planning, coverage area and robustness to communication failures improvement. We validated the approach with different combinations of control laws, number of UAVs and scenario hostility. The exposure of UAVs to threats decreased by at least 61% and at most 96% when the stealth policy is active, considering all simulation settings. Thus, highlighting that the stealth policy can be successfully used in missions that demand the increase of coverage area rate or robustness to failures.},

  title={Optimal Searching Time Allocation for Information Collection Under Cooperative Path Planning of Multiple UAVs},

  volume={6},

  pages={1030-1043},
  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an essential role in information collection where routing and time scheduling are two critical factors and are considered sequently. Given the paths of UAVs, metaheuristic algorithms are explored to allocate searching time of UAVs, which are hard to guarantee the optimal solution for time allocation. In this paper, a novel searchinG timE allocatioN undEr coopeRative pAth pLaning (GENERAL) is proposed to solve the optimal solution of the time allocation given paths of UAVs. GENERAL adopts a semi-greedy construction and a repair procedure to initialize and amend the routing solutions during iterations. Motivated by the Newton’s method from convex optimization domains, we introduce a new Perturbed Parametric Nonlinear Complementarity Problem function (PPNCP-function), which reformulates the time allocation problem as a smoothing system of equations according to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theorem. Then a smoothing Newton method is introduced to obtain the optimal time allocation solution with superlinear convergence. Experimental results empirically indicate the GENERAL’s effectiveness compared to Ant Colony Optimization with Simulated Annealing (ACO-SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Besides, some numerical results indicate that the smoothing Newton method with PPNCP function is promising. The emerging aspects of this paper include: 1) it integrates the path planning with time allocation problem for maximizing the information collection reward; 2) a new PPNCP-function and a smoothing Newton method have been proposed to solve the optimal time allocation under path planning of UAVs; 3) the theoretical convergence analysis of the smoothing Newton method has been provided in this paper.},

  abstract={Research on multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) cooperative surveillance systems serving Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as smart cities, precision logistics, etc., has become a hot topic. However, the target movement is unpredictable in an uncertain environment, and multiple UAVs are affected by obstacles or inaccessible regions, resulting in the decreased surveillance performance and even the loss of the target. This article is dedicated to determine the current surveillance environment through the 2-D laser scanner. At the cost of the energy consumption and the transmission unreliability, a multi-UAV cooperative path optimization (MCPO) model is designed to adjust the surveillance location of each UAV, which improves the target surveillance performance. Specifically, for different types of obstacles or inaccessible regions, we present a novel obstacle-avoidance selection strategy with two mechanisms in mind: 1) when some of UAVs encounter obstacles, but others can accurately monitor the target, a strict constraint mechanism is established to promptly adjust the surveillance location of each UAV, which ensures the accuracy of formation surveillance and 2) when all UAVs have to avoid obstacles, a fuzzy constraint mechanism is presented and combined with Lucas–Kanade (LK) method to expand the search range of the multi-UAV and enhance the flexible adjustment capability of the formation. To verify the superiority of the proposed optimization method, we develop a 3-D simulation experiment environment based on the UE4 platform and design several groups of experiments to analyze the effectiveness of MCPO. The experimental results demonstrate that MCPO can not only maintain the flight stability of multiple UAVs but also has satisfactory formation flexibility and surveillance accuracy.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel approach for cooperative drone avoidance trajectory planning based on the steering geometry model. Drones often encounter complex scenarios during flight, increasing the risk of collision with obstacles and subsequent damage. This study, demonstrates the existence of a unique shortest path among any number of flight paths between drone stations. Building upon the shortest path, considering the flight rates of drones A and B, along with the constraint of non-intersection, the priority of drone B reaching the target station is established. As drone A departs from the station, it rotates with a radius of 30 m for 12 cycles, ensuring that the two drones do not collide. Subsequently, by establishing the geometric relationship between the tangent of two steering circles and the tangent line of the shortest path, an optimized steering model for drone B to depart towards the shortest path is developed. This enables multiple adjustments of the flight trajectory of drone B towards the shortest path. The resulting length of the flight path for drone B is 4728.983 m, with a minimum time of 472.8983 s.},

  abstract={In this paper, the unmanned aerial velhicle (UAV) path planning problem with obstacles is disscussed for an air-ground collaborative system which is composed of a messenger UAV and multiple unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The messenger UAV needs to visit each UGV to collect and share information. The aim of this problem is to achieve a shortest path which makes the UAV fly over all UGVs while avoiding obstacles. By the Dubins model, the path planning problem is formulated as a Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood (DDTSPN) under obstacle constraints. To adapt to the change of UGVs' locations and reduce the complexity of tuning global path for obstacle avoidance, a moving horizon optimization strategy is porposed. After the UAV visits a UGV, the rest of UGVs' access sequence and access locations are determined using SOM method according to the real-time locations of UGVs. Further, the DAPF algorithm is presented to replan the path which enters the obstacle regions. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed path planning algorithm.},

  abstract={This paper investigates a patrol problem based on air-ground cooperation between multiple UAVs and police vehicles. Facing the uncertainty of patrol environment and patrol resources, the model guarantees the deterrence and emergency response capability of the patrol mission by optimizing the allocation strategy of patrol points and patrol routes. Relying on genetic algorithms, we encode patrol points and UAV launch/recovery points together to enhance the local search ability and convergence of the algorithm. Based on the real case of the D police station in Beijing, we explore the interactions among patrol elements and the impact on patrol tasks in different patrol environments. The results show that the Patrol missions formulated by Air-Ground Cooperative Patrol Optimization Model can be used to develop patrol tasks with better environmental adaptability. By analyzing the relationship between multiple groups of patrol elements, controlling the number of UAVs in future missions can improve the security of the area. And raise the ratio of hovering time in medium-risk areas to low-risk areas can improve the efficiency of patrols.},

  abstract={Reconstruction and mapping of outdoor urban environment are critical to a large variety of applications, ranging from large-scale city-level 3D content creation for augmented and virtual reality to the digital twin construction of smart cities and automatic driving. The construction of large-scale city-level 3D model will become another important medium after images and videos. We propose an autonomous approach to reconstruct the voxel model of the scene in real-time, and estimate the best set of viewing angles according to the precision requirement. These task views are assigned to the drones based on Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) optimization. In this process, the multi-level pipelining in the chip design method is applied to accelerate the parallelism between exploration and data acquisition. Our method includes: (1) real-time perception and reconstruction of scene voxel model and obstacle avoidance; (2) determining the best observation and viewing angles of scene geometry through global and local optimization; (3) assigning the task views to the drones and planning path based on the OMT optimization, and iterating continuously according to new exploration results; (4) expediting exploration and data acquisition in parallel through multi-stage pipeline to improve efficiency. Our method can schedule routes for drones according to the scene and its optimal acquisition perspective in real-time, which avoids the model void and lack of accuracy caused by traditional aerial 3D scanning using routes of cultivating land regardless of the object, and lays a solid foundation for the 3D real-life model to directly become the available 3D data source for AR and VR. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by collecting several groups of large-scale city-level data. Facts have proved that the accuracy and efficiency of reconstruction have been greatly improved.},

  abstract={Vision-based UAV-AGV collaborative system is one of the popular collaborative robotic systems which is advantageous in GPS (Global Positioning System) inaccessible areas for various applications. Inspection, surveillance, target tracking and environment mapping are the potential applications of the system. UAV can assist the navigation of AGV and AGV can support the long range missions of UAV. UAV carries a down facing camera for the relative localization of AGV. This configuration is the most popular vision-based UAV-AGV system. Collaborative motion between both agents is an important aspect of the system to perform any task. An image plane based autonomous waypoint navigation technique for the collaborative motion of UAV is developed in this paper. The collaborative task of UAV is to visit the various target positions in the image plane (while keeping AGV in field of view (FOV)) to gain the knowledge of the surroundings of AGV or to perform inspection at the target positions. Each target position is a waypoint to be reached by the UAV in the image plane. UAV plans minimum acceleration trajectories connecting each target location and reaches one by one. A sliding mode theory based novel kinematic controller is designed for tracking of the designed trajectories. The proposed method is validated in the Gazebo simulation tool. The method is useful in GPS denied environments for the UAV to plan smooth navigation to visit multiple positions in the image plane. UAV can reach various positions in sequence in the image plane to increase the knowledge of the environment. The method is also useful to perform discrete inspection of the horizontal infrastructures which are not reachable to AGV during collaborative inspection task.},

  number={},
  pages={168531-168546},
  abstract={Air-launched deployments of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms cause a broad spatial distribution among members, resulting inconsistencies in potential energy and wind conditions during flight. To optimize flight performance during swarm rendezvous, this paper proposes a trajectory planning method that enables members harvest wind energy. Integrate wind energy harvesting strategies for single vehicles with the spatial-temporal coordination of the swarm system. This strategy efficiently manages wind, mechanical, and electrical energies, thereby extending their endurance and range. This method is formulated using the Optimal Control Problem (OCP) framework, considering the dynamics of the swarm system. To ensure control input continuity and trajectory feasibility, the method incorporates constraints on thrust and its increment, which reduces the number of collocation points and lessens computational burden when the OCP is converted into a Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problem for solving. The optimal trajectory of a single UAV is employed as the initial guess to accelerate convergence and enhance solution global optimality. The trajectory planning results demonstrate that, to achieve mechanical energy consistency during the rendezvous process, members with differing initial potential energies after air-launch employ independent wind energy harvesting strategies to compensate for trajectory energy costs. This method optimally plans collaborative trajectories for multiple vehicles within spatiotemporal constraints, significantly broadening their reachable domain. The comprehensive management of energy reserves from air-launched vehicles, including potential and electrical energy, along with the harvesting of wind energy, can significantly extend the range and endurance of air-launched swarm missions.},

  abstract={The searching and monitoring of diffusive sources, especially those with dangerous radiative sources, are of great significance to public safety and personal health. Due to the influence of the environment and the field, it is difficult to ensure precise source seeking and real-time performance. Existing searching methods use manned machines, robotics or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which are easily affected by the environmental situation and the field. They are also possible to be blocked during the marching journey, resulting in a failure of the task. The rapid development of small unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which includes unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) can solve this problem. In an UAS, UAVs with the installed sensors are able to detect the 3D space in the air, which are barely affected by the ground condition and could communicate with the ground station, and other UAVs via the network. Due to the dangers of the radiative source, it is important to find out the exact location in a short time. Based on the cooperative seeking, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be developed to shorten the process of the source seeking, and estimate the radiative source accurately. Considering the actual situation of the UASs-based cooperative source seeking, this paper presents the models of the UAVs and the radiative source, introduces the fractional order potential field (FOPF) for collision avoidance and path planning, establishes the real-world simulation platform, and utilizes the EKF to effectively localize the accurate position of the radiative source.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the intelligent covert communication for a cooperative UAV swarm. In particular, we develop a dynamic migration mechanism of the UAV swarm for carrying out the covert communication with the aid of auxiliary jamming. With the goal of maximizing the covert rate and maximizing the probability of detection errors, we construct the multi-objective optimization problem of covert communication scheduling. Specifically, we propose a Double Deep Q network based covert transmission scheme (DDQN-CTS), which jointly optimizes the scheduling, speed, and transmission power of the UAV swarm. The UAV swarm, playing as the agent, continuously explores the optimization variables to obtain the maximum reward, i.e. the objective function, in the dynamic interaction with the environment. The simulation results show the convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm, and compared with the greedy algorithm, the proposed DDQN-CTS can achieve the best trade-off between covert rate and the probability of detection errors.},

Exploited the flexible deployment and agile mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this work proposes to dispatch the UAV with edge computing capabilities as an aerial energy source to wirelessly power FL users and as an aerial server for model aggregation. In this regard, we investigate a resource allocation problem that minimizes the energy consumption of FL users and the aerial server.

  abstract={The autonomous landing of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on a moving unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) demands precise spatial synchronization of both vehicle systems. A promising strategy to achieve a successful landing in this heterogeneous rendezvous maneuver is the subdivision of the synchronization control task into a trajectory planner and underlying trajectory tracking controllers. For this purpose, a central trajectory planner, which is the subject of this paper, computes feasible trajectories for the UAV and UGV that converge towards each other. Current approaches mainly rely either on computationally expensive optimization problems or on potentially inaccurate linearization. In this paper, a new model predictive trajectory planning scheme based on the flatness property of kinematic models of the fixed-wing UAV and UGV is presented. By using vehicle models with this property, quadratic programs (QP) are formulated that can be solved efficiently in each time instance without linearization of the nonlinear vehicle models, which is a novel approach in this application. Crucial requirements for the trajectory planner are that it reduces the horizontal distance between the vehicles to below 0.5 m while maintaining safety constraints to allow safe landing, and a sampling rate of 40 Hz to allow rapid replanning in case of disturbances. To overcome the issue of input constraint transformation between the original and the flat models, different approximation methods are investigated. Simulation results with simple kinematic vehicle models and high-fidelity dynamic models using underlying trajectory tracking controllers and navigation filters are presented that demonstrate that the proposed trajectory planning method allows safe landing maneuvers with the considered vehicle setup.},

  abstract={Navigation of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) in unknown environments is an active area of research for mobile robotics. A main hindering factor for UGV navigation is the limited range of the on-board sensors that process only restricted areas of the environment at a time. In addition, most existing approaches process sensor information under the assumption of a static environment. This restrains the exploration capability of the UGV especially in time-critical applications such as search and rescue. The cooperation with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can provide the UGV with an extended perspective of the environment which enables a better-suited path planning solution that can be adjusted on demand. In this work, we propose a UAV-UGV cooperative path planning approach for dynamic environments by performing semantic segmentation on images acquired from the UAV’s view via a deep neural network. The approach is evaluated in a car park scenario, with the goal of providing a path plan to an empty parking space for a ground-based vehicle. The experiments were performed on a created dataset of real-world car park images located in Croatia and Germany, in addition to images from a simulated environment. The segmentation results demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach in producing maps of the dynamic environment on demand and accordingly generating path plans for ground-based vehicles.},

  abstract={In the scenario of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle -Wireless Sensor Network(UAV-WSN) collaborative assisted communication, traditional research focuses on the acquisition rate and energy consumption optimization of UAVs, without considering the underlying wireless sensor network. In the air-ground collaborative disaster relief scenario proposed in this article, a UAV path planning framework based on binary particle swarm algorithm(BPSO) is proposed to solve the UAV trajectory planning problem in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks. The framework proposed in this paper realizes path planning for the dynamic allocation of data transmission time and acquisition energy consumption between collection nodes and UAVs. The time of data transmission and the energy consumption of collection nodes for UAV are the constraints. Considering the data migration of the underlying network(WSN), aiming at maximizing the value of data utilization. The simulation experiments validated the good performance in terms of integrity and efficiency. Compared with the algorithm that does not consider the underlying network data migration, the algorithm proposed in this paper can maximize the energy utilization efficiency of the UAV. In this paper, the data migration of the underlying network is considered, and a node is completely collected, which ensures the integrity of the data, and the performance is 55.19% better than the algorithm without considering the integrity. At the same time, as for collection efficiency, the performance of the framework is 38.04% better than the greedy algorithm, 18.55% better than the OR-Tools path planning algorithm proposed by Google, and 48.07% better than the straight algorithm.

However, efficient distributed information gathering such as target search by a team of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains very challenging in constrained environment. In this paper, we propose a new approach to learn resource-bounded multi-agent coordination for a multi-UAV target search problem subject to stringent communication bandwidth constraints in a dynamic uncertain environment. It relies on a new information-theoretic co-evolutionary algorithm to solve cooperative search path planning over receding horizons, providing agents with mutually adaptive and self-organizing behavior. The anytime coordination algorithm is coupled to a divergence-based information-sharing policy to exchange high-value world-state information under limited communication bandwidth.

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gradually and frequently applied in a wide range of fields, and how to reasonably control the trajectory of UAVs to better accomplish the tasks is an important challenge for people. Based on the MP-GWO algorithm that combines the Gray Wolf optimization algorithm and multiple swarm ideas, this paper introduces nonlinear decreasing control parameters for the Multi-population Grey Wolf Optimization (MP-GWO) algorithm, and proposes a position updating strategy combining the dynamic weighted averaging method and the static averaging method, in order to improve the algorithm’s convergence accuracy and convergence speed.

  abstract={With the upgrading of voltage level, the electromagnetic environment of large-scale hub substations and the electrical, thermal, and force problems of power equipment are becoming increasingly prominent, and lean inspection is crucial. However, to cope with substation inspection scenarios with serious electromagnetic interference, the path nodes planned by the traditional grid method (TGM) are too many and cannot maintain a certain safety distance from obstacles. Therefore, this paper proposes a grid graph modeling method applicable to UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)-intelligent robot cooperative inspection path planning. First, the raster is generated based on the actual substation layout structure, and then the vertices of the obstacle raster are extracted as feature points as new alternative points to plan the path. Then the artificial potential field (APF) method improved by large neighborhood search (LNS) is used to construct the UAV-intelligent robot cooperative inspection path optimization model. The results show that the new raster modeling method can be applied to the path planning of the improved Artificial Potential Field method, and the path can be optimized to make the inspection safer, especially for the operation of the UAV, and can improve the convergence speed of the algorithm, which is better than the traditional raster modeling method in terms of the comprehensive performance.},

  abstract={Flying Ad-Hoc Network (FANET) is a special type of Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) consisted of a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs). Mission planning for effective cooperative UAV searching must take into account the connectivity of UAVs for information sharing among UAVs in the FANET. Traditional mission planning usually uses predefined routes or use simple mobility models to generate the trajectories of UAVs, which do not take network connectivity as an important factor for high-quality cooperative searching. On the other hand, many innovative FANET mobility models have been investigated only for FANET simulation. In this paper, we propose a framework applying a recent group mobility model to mission planning with consideration on the network connectivity. For this purpose, we extend the Spatiotemporally Correlated Group Mobility Model (STGM) with adaptivity on its parameters that decide the spatial or temporal correlations among UAVs. Next, we introduce an area information coverage metric to evaluate the quality of mission planning enhanced by this adaptive mobility model. Finally, an algorithm is designed to optimize the metric. The experimental results show that our framework gains impressive improvements on effective information collection by the UAV swarm.},

An enhanced multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is introduced to address the optimization challenge in cooperative multi-UAV scenarios. Within this framework, each UAV, acting as an agent, devises strategies for movement, data offloading, and resource allocation based on the current states of vehicles and fellow UAVs.

  abstract={Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown wide applicability in collaborative systems such as autonomous driving and smart cities for its ability of learning through interaction. With the recent development of drone networks, researchers have also applied MARL to address the trajectory planning problems. However, the dynamic environment and the limited battery capacity are still challenging for using MARL to achieve efficient collaborative task execution. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware MARL model as an attempt to tackle these challenges, leveraging Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with individual reward functions driven by the task execution progress and the remaining battery of drones. We conduct a set of simulation studies for the proposed mode and compare it with the shared reward MARL Li2022MARL to explore the impact of credit assignment in MARL. The results indicate that our proposed model can achieve at least 80% success rate regardless of the task locations and lengths. Similar to the shared reward mode, the individual reward mode can achieve a better success rate when the task density is high, and it can hit nearly a 100% success rate when task density gets close to 40%. The true advantage of our proposed model with individual reward is revealed when scaling up the environment. The comparison to the shared reward MARL shows that the our proposed model is more robust towards the change of the environment size and agent numbers. It can achieve higher success rate with fewer steps due to the clarity of the goal which improves energy efficiency even better.},

  abstract={Nowadays, multiple types of equipment, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and automatic surface vehicles (ASVs), have been deployed in maritime search and rescue (SAR). However, due to the lack of base stations (BSs), how to complete rescue while maintaining communication between vehicles is an unresolved challenge. In this paper, we design an efficient and fault-tolerant communication solution by jointly optimizing vehicles' trajectory, offloading scheduling, and routing topology for a heterogeneous vehicle system. First, we model several essential factors in maritime SAR, including the impact of ocean currents, the observational behavior of UAVs, the fault tolerance of relay networks, resource management of mobile edge computing (MEC), and energy consumption. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated, aiming at minimizing time and energy consumption while increasing the fault tolerance of relay networks. Then, we transfer the objective into a decentralized partially observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) and introduce multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to search for a collaborative strategy. Specifically, two MARL approaches with different training styles are evaluated, and three techniques are added for improving performance, including sharing parameters, normalized generalized-advantage-estimation (GAE), and preserving-outputs-precisely-while-adaptively-rescaling-targets (Pop-Art). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach, named heterogeneous vehicles multi-agent proximal policy optimization (HVMAPPO), outperforms other baselines in efficiency and fault tolerance of communication.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-based cooperative target search plays an important role in the scenario of complex and urgent search missions.

This paper investigates the problem of joint computation offloading and trajectory planning for a multi-UAV system integrated with edge computing. Our goal is to minimize the total uncertainty of the target search area while considering the limited energy and search time of UAVs. To adapt to highly dynamic environments, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is applied in this paper. We propose a novel approach of Action Masks and Branch-network based-Proximal Policy Optimization (AMB-PPO), by which a multi-branch network structure and action masks are introduced into PPO to address the challenges of large joint action spaces and low learning efficiency. The numerical results demonstrate that, when compared to other existing DRL methods, the proposed AMB-PPO algorithm performs better in reducing the total uncertainty of the target search area with higher learning efficiency and faster algorithm convergence.},

According to the change of environment, the prediction time-domain of RHO is changed, and RHO with variable step-ahead prediction is introduced. Moreover, the pigeons-inspired cooperation-competition (PICC) scheme for multi-UAVs is designed, including cooperation module and competition module. Through information interaction, multi-UAVs can expand their search horizons, and cooperate with each other to improve search efficiency. In addition, the environmental cognitive information map (ECIM) and value income function (VIF) is also reasonably improved. Several contrastive simulations demonstrate that compared with other existing approaches, the proposed algorithm uses less time and shows a better performance of target search.},

  abstract={This paper addresses a well-documented open problem on the tracking target of the multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to the inconsistent of attitude and position in the process of flight. The main contribution is to study a UAV cooperative formation control of tracking a moving target and analyze the flight stability of the designed controller when only knowing the UAV local information. The path planning of a single UAV and multiple UAV cooperative formation tracking of a moving target is studied. First, the feedback control is used to ensure heading convergence for the path planning of a single UAV. Furthermore, we use a variable airspeed controller to achieve the desired angular spacing and build the information architecture using graph theory for the UAV formation tracking of moving targets. The communication data management module at the cloud stores and transmits to UAV by the ground station. The ground command can maintain a UAV control center which gets access to the cloud for the UAV activity management. In addition, the design of a distributed control law is achieved based on the type of information construction between UAVs. The simulation results show that the designed controller is robust for tracking moving targets and achieves good flight-stability when tracking such targets.},

  abstract={With the popularity and development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, the UAV coverage path planning problem has also emerged. In this paper, we propose a new model of UA V coverage path planning problem, which uses multiple UAVs to cover a certain large area cooperatively, and considers the energy constraint of UA Vs on flight distance, UA V energy replenishment and UA V recovery in the coverage process. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach to solve the problem. In the first stage, we propose a region decomposition method based on a regular triangular grid, which converts the search region into a graph composed of nodes and edges. In the second stage, we use mixed linear integer programming (MILP) method to plan the coverage path based on the graph generated in the first stage. We use the actual parameters such as the drone's own camera, speed, energy, etc. to dissecte a rectangular area and accurately solve the MILP model, in the process of solving we designed three different scenarios to verify the feasibility and versatility of the model, and the solution results meet the expectations. We also observed the effect of UA V base location on the solving speed and the effect of UA V flight altitude on the model solving target value.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of smart power grid, the operation mode of substation is gradually complex, and the operation condition of transmission and transformation equipment fluctuates greatly. However, the traditional intelligent robot inspection method of substation may have some problems, such as limited monitoring scope, redundant inspection path and untargeted monitoring, which cannot meet the inspection requirements. Therefore, this paper proposes an operation and maintenance strategy based on A* algorithm to inspect substation with multi-group intelligent robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). First according to the importance of the substation equipment instrument, failure rate and determine the fault happens on the system the influence degree of the equipment required for monitoring frequency, thus realize monitoring equipment hierarchies, and based on the substation physical environment monitoring division, according to the equipment level in each area, A* algorithm is adopted to improve the variety of path planning. Matlab simulation shows that compared with the traditional full-area substation inspection strategy, this method can effectively reduce the inspection time, shorten the path length, and guarantee the full coverage of all monitoring task points while taking into account the monitoring frequency required by each equipment. Simulation results show that the proposed method has good security and timeliness, and has high application value in substation inspection planning.},

  abstract={Multiunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have shown immense potential in handling complex tasks in large-scale, dynamic, and cold-start (i.e., limited prior knowledge) scenarios, such as wildfire suppression. Due to the dynamic and stochastic environmental conditions, the scheduling for sensing tasks (i.e., fire monitoring) and operation tasks (i.e., fire suppression) should be executed concurrently to enable real-time information collection and timely intervention of the environment. However, the planning inclinations of sensing and operation tasks are typically inconsistent and evolve over time, complicating the task of identifying the optimal strategy for each UAV. To solve this problem, this article proposes SOScheduler, a collaborative multi-UAV scheduling framework for integrated sensing and operation in large-scale and dynamic wildfire environments. We introduce a spatiotemporal confidence-aware assessment model to dynamically and directly pinpoint locations that can optimally enhance the understanding of environmental dynamics and operational effectiveness, as well as a priority graph-instructed scalable scheduler to coordinate multi-UAV in an efficient manner. Experiments on real multi-UAV testbeds and large-scale physical feature-based simulations show that our SOScheduler reduces the fire expansion ratio by 59% and enhances the fire coverage ratio by 190% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions.},

  abstract={In this work, we propose a physical approximation scheme - Random Opportunistic and Selective Exploration (ROSE) - for aerial localization of survivors by using a collaborative swarm of IoT-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAV swarm performs a simultaneous multi-pronged search of a given zone by dividing the search region among the swarm members. This multi-pronged search strategy speeds-up the search, and the division of search areas among the swarm members avoids redundant exploration of an already explored location. As the communication range of the member UAVs is limited, the swarm members communicate opportunistically among themselves to share the information of the visited sites. We formulate the various probabilities associated with opportunistic communication of these aerial IoT nodes and simulate the performance of the approximation algorithm based on these formulations. Simulation results of the proposed approach successfully locate 100% of the ground targets within an acceptable time-frame, and out-performs established searching schemes such as the truncated Levy walk, frontier-based search, and sweep search.},

  title={Data Collection Task Planning of a Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in Forest Fire Monitoring},

  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={109847-109864},
  abstract={This article studies the data collection task planning for a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in forest fire monitoring. Multiple wireless-based detection nodes (DNs) are distributed in high-risk areas of the forest to monitor the surrounding environment. The task of UAV is to circularly fly to them and collect the environmental data. Because of the kinematic constraints of UAV and the effective communication range between UAV and DN, this problem can be generally regarded as a Dubins traveling salesman problem with neighborhood (DTSPN). A bi-level hybridization-based metaheuristic algorithm (BLHMA) is proposed for solving this problem. At the first level, differential evolution (DE) optimizes the continuous-valued communication positions and UAV headings by the population-based search. For the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) corresponding to the combination of the positions and headings generated by DE, a constructive heuristic based on self-organized multi-agent competition (SOMAC) is proposed to determine the discrete collection sequence. By competitive iterations in such a cooperative way in DE, a high-quality data collection tour can be generated. At the second level, a local search based on multistage approximate gradient is proposed to further refine the positions and headings, which accelerates the convergence of the BLHMA. Referring to a real-world scene of forest fire monitoring, the simulation experiments are designed, and comparative results show that BLHMA can find significantly shorter data collection tours in most cases over three state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed UAV data collection planning algorithm is conducive to the efficient execution of the forest fire monitoring data collection mission and the energy saving of UAV.},

  abstract={Collaborative exploration using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has become increasingly popular in the past decade. This study addresses real-time autonomous tracking and landing of a UAV on a moving ground vehicle, which is fundamental for the UAV-UGV collaborative exploration. The method proposed in this study estimates the relative pose and velocity between a UAV and UGV, and uses model predictive control for UAV trajectory planning while considering the field of view of the camera onboard the UAV. We elaborate the hardware-in-the-loop simulator (HITL) with a physical companion computer, and confirm that the proposed method enables a UAV to land on a UGV traversing on rough terrain based on online computations in the HITL. Additionally, we present statistical analysis of the simulation results of typical and computationally demanding scenarios to elucidate the computational cost on the real machine.},

  pages={30070-30083},
  abstract={Aiming at the problem of using fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (clusters) for rapid coverage search of submarines in large-scale sea areas, the strategy of using a single UAV for coverage searching in form of Dubins curve (SCSDC) and the strategy of using fixed-wing UAVs cluster for cooperative coverage searching in form of parallel intervals (SCSPI) were proposed after selective removal of concave points in complex irregular concave polygonal areas. First, the cost mathematical model of cooperative search for multiple UAVs was established. At the same time, considering the limitation of turning radius of UAVs, a Dubins curve coverage search strategy was proposed to avoid search blind areas. Second, the judgment conditions of “edge length threshold” and “angle threshold” were introduced, and the method of selective removal of concave points was proposed to transform the irregular concave polygon area into a regular convex polygonal area. Then, to reduce the searching cost of UAV’s “ $\Omega $ ” turning type and improve the timeliness of its submarine search, a strategy of UAV cluster cooperative coverage search in the form of parallel interval was proposed. Finally, a comparative verification experiment was designed for the strategy of SCSDC and SCSPI in a complex irregular polygon search area. The simulation results show that selection of the two different area coverage search strategies needs to be determined according to actual combat requirements. The experimental results well verify the effectiveness and application scope of the two area coverage search strategies, and provide information support for subsequent antisubmarine action.},
