  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a pivotal role in augmenting multi-access edge computing by facilitating low-latency services for ground units (GUs), especially in areas where the ground infrastructure is inadequate or damaged. In this context, the UAV trajectory planning and caching strategies assume paramount importance to ensure low-latency service delivery. Due to the limited caching and computing resources at a single UAV, it alone cannot provide effective services for a large number of GUs. In this paper, we design a novel cooperative framework for low-latency service provisioning by coordinating multiple UAVs's trajectories and service caching strategies. We formulate a latency minimization problem to jointly optimize both service caching and trajectory planning of multiple UAVs. However, due to the high dimension and coupling of multiple UAVs' movement and service caching, the optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, which is typically an NP-hard problem, and we propose an effective algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient to solve the high dimensional, non-convex, and continuous long-term optimization problem. Numerous experiments confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly better performance in reducing the total system delay than other baseline algorithms.},

  abstract={In this paper, we study the No-wait Drone Scheduling Traveling Salesman Problem (NW-DSTSP) based on Hybrid Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (HAPGA). It is supposed that a truck sets out from a depot with some drones, and they need to arrive at several clustered customer locations. The NW-DSTSP seeks for a dynamic route of the truck and drones where all customer needs are met with minimal makespan (or operating costs). We construct a three-step solution to formulate NW-DSTSP as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and propose the HAPGA to obtain solutions for small and medium-sized instances. The model is compared with the K-means clustering and TSP models, while HAPGA is compared with PSO and GA. The results show that the model and algorithm we proposed are more effective.},

  abstract={The reconfigurable unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV) has the ability to create and break physical links to self-assemble and self-disassemble in midair. For the changes in task or environment, this system can dynamically disassemble the rectangular structure into multiple individual UAV modules or integrate these UAV modules into a whole. For practical applications, the R-UAV requires collaborative decision-making for autonomous navigation in complex environments. However, the navigation problem of the R-UAV has not been investigated. In this paper, we propose a dynamic multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DMADDPG) algorithm for autonomous navigation of R-UAV. This algorithm introduces the leader agent assignment mechanism and a collaborative experience reward. The former deals with the action conflict problem caused by the disappearance of the UAV agent when multiple UAV modules are assembled. The latter provides guidance for the UAV agent to plan a collision-free and efficient trajectory. We validate our strategy in both simulation and practical scenarios, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can generate reasonable and efficient paths for R-UAV in the presence of obstacles.

  abstract={The multi-UAV task allocation problem is a multi-constrained combined optimization problem. To obtain the best benefit of the problem, this paper establishes a task allocation model that matches the battlefield environment. And the path planning between UAV and target is completed simultaneously. The real flight distance is used to replace the straight-line distance to realize the tight coupling of task allocation and path planning. A modified marine predator algorithm is proposed firstly in this paper to better solve the task allocation model. The exploitation and exploration ability of the algorithm is enhanced by using a logarithmic spiral strategy and a Gaussian distribution estimation strategy. The improved algorithm is then discretized and applied to solve the multi-UAV task allocation model. The simulation results show that the use of the real flight distance instead of the straight-line distance can plan a more reasonable task execution sequence and get a better combat profit under the consideration of the real terrain and various types of threats. The improved algorithm can solve the model stably and effectively, with better solution accuracy and faster convergence speed.},

  abstract={It is an effective way to execute a complicated mission by cooperating unmanned vehicles. This paper focuses on a search- and-track (SAT) mission for an underwater target, and the mission is implemented by combining an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In the cooperative path planning model, the mission is divided into the search phase and the track phase, and the goals of the two phases are to maximize the search space and minimize the terminal error respectively. The constraints contain the maneuverability of vehicles and communication ranges between vehicles. Strategies based on random simulation experiments and asynchronous planning are developed to design the cooperative path planning algorithm in the two phases, and the paths are generated by an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm in a centralized or a distributed mode. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can deal with different situations. The UAV&USV&AUV system is superior to the USV&AUV system in the SAT mission.},

  abstract={Detection of moving targets is a basic but challenging function of drone-based surveillance systems (DBSSs), which could give rise to various potential applications in smart city and intelligent transportation. However, how to detect moving targets in the dynamic high-altitude environment with restricted computational resources is one of the most critical ones. Furthermore, during the detection, the moving target could travel in dynamic speed and be blocked by dense-obstructer, such as woods and buildings. In this paper, we develop an online drone-based moving target detection (ODMTD)system, which performs moving target detection in dense-obstructer areas. Specifically, first, our proposed system simultaneously performs adaptive path planning and autonomous drone flight via the combination of historical path cost and energy loss computation by using drone attitudes. Second, to detect moving targets in the dynamic background, we develop an algorithm of combing the speed up robust features and approximate nearest neighbors, shortly SURF-ANN, for estimating and compensating the global motion of the background. Finally, in order to calibrate distorted images taken by the camera obliquely, we utilize perspective transformation to remap images into another plane, and then detect moving targets by subtracting registered images (SRI). Furthermore, real-time outdoor high-altitude experiments, by comprising with the state-of-art methods, demonstrate the effectiveness of our ODMTD system.},

  abstract={Persistent surveillance and reconnaissance tasks in mobile cooperative sensor networks are key to constructing recognized domain pictures over a variety of civilian and military problem instances. However, efficient information gathering for a task such as target search by a team of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) still remains a major challenge to achieve system-wide performance objective. Given problem complexity, most proposed distributed target search solutions so far consider simplifying assumptions such as predetermined path planning coordination strategy with implicit communication and ad hoc heuristics, and severely constrained resources. In this paper, we extend previous work reported on multi-UAV target search by learning resource-bounded multi-agent coordination, involving explicit action control coordination. The approach first relies on a new information-theoretic co-evolutionary algorithm to solve cooperative search path planning over receding horizons, providing agents with mutually adaptive and selforganizing behavior. The anytime algorithm is coupled to an extended information-sharing policy to periodically exchange world-state information and projected agent intents. Preliminary results show the value of the proposed approach in comparison to existing techniques or methods.},

  abstract={The UAV swarm has been applied widely in various fields, which requires it to have more powerful capabilities. Area search is an important application of a UAV swarm, and large amounts of researches have been conducted to optimize the swarm's behavior. However, there are still some challenges of area search. The execution of search tasks usually depends on global cognition, which is difficult to obtain in reality. In addition, the search efficiency of the swarm is low and the ability to adapt to the environment is poor. In response to these challenges, a swarm cooperative area search system is proposed. The system consists of two modules: a global planning module and an autonomous flight module. In the global planning module, when the UAV swarm can obtain GPS information, the optimal area search routes of the UAVs are planned in advance to realize accurate area search. The autonomous flight module enables the UAVs to independently generate and optimize the control structure independent of GPS information. C-search improves the ability of UAV swarms to execute area search tasks, and increases the adaptability to a variety of task scenarios and robustness to harsh task environments. The effectiveness of the system is verified by experiments. The results show that the UAV swarm can complete the area search task in a variety of task scenarios.},

  pages={1171-1187},
  abstract={Harvesting data from distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices with multiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging problem requiring flexible path planning methods. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a scheme for observing cooperative Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV), using a rotorcraft Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with camera movements (tilt and yaw) prioritized over UAV movements. Most of the current researches consider a fixed-wing type UAV for surveillance of multiple moving targets (MMT), whose functionality is limited to just UAV movements. Experiments in simulation are conducted and verified that, prioritizing camera movements increased the number of times each USV is visited (on an average by 5.68 times more), decreased the percentage of the duration that the UAV is not observing any USV (on an average by 19.8%) and increased the efficiency by decreasing the distance traveled by the UAV (on an average by 747 pixels) for the six test cases. Autonomous repositioning of the UAV at regular intervals to observe USVs during a disaster scenario will provide the operator with better situational awareness. Using a rotorcraft over a fixed-wing type UAV provides the operator with a flexibility of observing the target for the required duration by hovering and freedom of unrestricted movements, which help improve the efficiency of target observation.},

  abstract={Collaborative coverage path planning (CCPP) refers to obtaining the shortest paths passing over all places except obstacles in a certain area or space. A multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaborative CCPP algorithm is proposed for the urban rescue search or military search in outdoor environment. Due to flexible control of small UAVs, it can be considered that all UAVs fly at the same altitude, that is, they perform search tasks on a two-dimensional plane. Based on the agents' motion characteristics and environmental information, a mathematical model of CCPP problem is established. The minimum time for UAVs to complete the CCPP is the objective function, and complete coverage constraint, no-fly constraint, collision avoidance constraint, and communication constraint are considered. Four motion strategies and two communication strategies are designed. Then a distributed CCPP algorithm is designed based on hybrid strategies. Simulation results compared with pattern-based genetic algorithm (PBGA) and random search method show that the proposed method has stronger real-time performance and better scalability and can complete the complete CCPP task more efficiently and stably.},

  abstract={In complex oceanic environments, efficient data collection for underwater Internet of Things (IoT) is a challenging issue. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology provides an emerging solution to this problem. This paper designs a UAV-assisted underwater IoT data collection system architecture. In this architecture, UAVs collect data through relay cooperation, effectively reducing the flight time for remote UAVs to return to the seashore base station (SBS). We propose a hybrid collaborative data collection scheme (HCDC) to generate a collection strategy for UAVs. In this scheme, we first allocate a balanced workload to the UAVs and determine the initial traversal order for each UAV to collect data from various surface sink nodes (SSNs). Then we introduce a relay matching algorithm to establish the relay relationships among UAVs. Finally, we present a trajectory planning algorithm based on hierarchical multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed HCDC scheme significantly reduces both the flight time and data collection time of the UAVs, thereby minimizing the age of information (AoI). Moreover, compared to other data collection schemes, HCDC performs better in networks of various scales.},

However, in such UAV-assisted communication networks, the complexity of multi-agent scenarios creates challenges due to the problem of learning and decision-making in complex tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm that optimizes UAV trajectory planning and autonomous clustering of user equipment (UE) for communication. The proposed algorithm leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning and multi-agent cognitive consistency to improve UE communication decisions in interference-prone environments. Simulation results confirm the convergence of the proposed algorithm and reveal special strength in coordinating spectrum utilization in complex air-ground environments.},

  abstract={The existing city traffic surveillance systems are mainly based on passive monitoring by using fixed sensors, which cannot fully meet the highly dynamic monitoring requirements of intelligent traffic. To address this concern, this paper employs flexible Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide active monitoring services in a cooperative way. Firstly, we comprehensively consider the energy consumption and network connectivity constraints of the UAV system to establish a multi-UAV-based mobile monitoring model aiming at maximizing task energy efficiency. Then, we formulate the collaborative multi-UAV surveillance problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process to determine the optimal strategies for UAVs. Next, we propose a Collaborative Multi-UAV Deployment (CMUD) algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) by designing an effective reward function and improving the experience replay scheme. In addition, we introduce a policy integration scheme for the proposed CMUD algorithm to solve the problem that the UAV overly relies on the movement strategies of other UAVs in the non-stationary multi-UAV traffic monitoring environment. Simulation results show that the proposed CMUD algorithm can effectively accelerate the exploration of movement strategies with the guarantee of stable connectivity and efficiently improve task energy efficiency.},

  abstract={In the multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, the cooperative computation among multiple UAVs can improve the overall computation service capability. Multi-UAV MEC systems can meet the quality of service requirements for computation intensive applications of ground terminals (GTs) in complex field environments, emergency disaster relief and other special scenarios. In this paper, a multi-UAV cooperative computation framework is proposed while taking the GT movement and random arrival of computation tasks into consideration. A long-term optimization problem is formulated for the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and resource allocation, subject to minimizing the total GT computation task completion time and the total system energy consumption. To solve this problem, a joint multiple time-scale optimization algorithm is proposed. In particular, the optimization problem is decomposed into a long time-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning subproblem and a short time-scale resource allocation subproblem. The proximal policy optimization algorithm is invoked to solve the long time-scale subproblem. The greedy algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method are employed to solve the short time-scale subproblem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can quickly adapt to different degrees of environmental dynamics and outperforms the benchmark algorithm for different task requirements and available resources.},

  abstract={The development of autonomous vehicles or advanced driving assistance platforms has had a great leap forward to get closer to human daily life over the last decade. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to achieve an efficient and fully autonomous vehicle or driving assistance platform due to many strict requirements and complex situations or unknown environments. One of the main remaining challenges is a robust situation awareness in autonomous vehicles when the environment is unknoen. An autonomous system with a poor situation awareness due to low quantity or quality of data may directly or indirectly cause serious consequences. For instance, a person's life might be at risk due to a delay caused by a long or incorrect path planning of an autonomous ambulance. Internet of Everything (IoE) is currently becoming a prominent technology for many applications such as automation. In this paper, we propose an IoE-based architecture consisting of a heterogeneous team of cars and drones for enhancing situational awareness in autonomous cars, especially when dealing with critical cases of natural disasters. In particular, we show how an autonomous car can plan in advance the possible paths to a given destination, and send orders to other vehicles. These, in turn, perform terrain reconnaissance for avoiding obstacles and dealing with difficult situations. Together with a map merging algorithm deployed into the team autonomous vehicles, the proposed architecture can help to save traveling distance and time significantly in case of complex scenarios.},

  abstract={Swarms of unmanned aircraft are the inevitable future of the aerospace industry. In recent years, swarming robots and aircraft have been a subject of much interest; however, many research projects make impractical assumptions such as point mass dynamics with no aerodynamic effects for aircraft models, and most works stop short of fully validating their methods via flight testing. This work presents a proximity based guidance, navigation, and control of multi-agent fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems in an unstructured environment. A scalable swarm navigation method is developed using adaptive moving mesh partial differential equations controlled by the free energy heat flow equation. To emulate the physics-based dynamic characteristics of fixed-wing UASs, mesh nodes are constrained by aircraft six degrees of freedom equations of motion. An optimal control based path planning using virtual points was developed and constrained with aircraft dynamical limitations. Lateral acceleration is used for lateral guidance of aircraft and the aircraft pitch attitude error is used for longitudinal guidance of multi-agent unmanned aerial systems. A decentralized optimal automatic controller was developed to control each system. Using an advanced in-house autopilot system, validation and verification flight tests were successfully conducted using two large unmanned aerial systems with four meter wingspans flying at 35 knots.},

  abstract={In the emergency rescue scenario where the communication infrastructure is damaged, Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) networking communication, as a part of the 6G air-space-ground integrated network system, plays a huge role in the establishment of the emergency communication network. In this paper, we fully consider the distribution of rescue areas, the type of tasks and the characteristics of UAVs, and design the TaskPOI-based multi-UAVs collaborative trajectory planning algorithm (TMCTP) based on regional tasks, aiming to improve the completed efficiency of rescue tasks and the utilization rate of energy consumption in the UAV backbone network. Firstly, we filter the population-intensive points of interest (PiPOI) region based on the location heat map of population density distribution and use the K-means clustering algorithm to generate task points of interest (TaskPOI) and use the neural collaborative filtering algorithm to determine the task priority and different priorities correspond to different task types. Then, we design a single UAV flight model and a multi-UAVs cooperative flight model. At the same time, considering the flight energy consumption, communication energy consumption and data acquisition energy consumption of UAV, the energy consumption equilibrium distribution model is designed to ensure that multi-UAVs have low energy consumption and balance the residual energy distribution while completing various levels of tasks. Finally, based on UAV flight model, energy consumption equilibrium distribution model, and combined with task priority of TaskPOI, TMCTP algorithm for the trajectory planning of the UAV group is designed by using multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. The experimental results show that in the TMCTP algorithm, the success rate of the UAV arriving at the goal and the completed rate of the action are converged to 1, the times of collisions is converged to 0, and the average reward, the loss of algorithm are all converged to a good degree, and the PiPOI coverage rate in the area exceeds 60%. In terms of energy consumption, the difference between the energy consumption of each UAV is small, and compared with the average residual energy using GP3, the difference is not large, indicating that the algorithm can improve the PiPOI coverage of the entire rescue area without generating a large energy consumption. In this way, the UAV group after arriving at the goal will provide communication services for the rescue area and improve the connectivity and life cycle of the 6G air network.},

  abstract={Given the constraints associated with a single UAV performing target tracking tasks in complex environments, this study employs a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to investigate the problem of multi-directional target tracking in a UAV swarm. The agent’s action space and state space are designed using the local observable Markov model, while the reward function for cluster target tracking is formulated based on the potential field function and the collision cone principle. Furthermore, to address the issue of over-fitting during the training process, Gaussian noise is incorporated into the joint advantage function to mitigate the influence of individual agents on the overall advantage. The simulation results demonstrate that the UAV swarm outperforms a single UAV in terms of target tracking. Furthermore, when compared to the MAPPO algorithm, the enhanced version of MAPPO exhibits superior training efficacy and target tracking performance.},

  abstract={Thelast decade has witnessed growing research interests in the path-planning problem for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) equipped with RGB-D cameras or LiDARs. However, apart from their extremely high cost, these sensors may be obscured by obstacles, which makes them impractical for many complex scenarios. Besides, most of the existing works for path planning have not considered energy efficiency for UGVs that are usually constrained by limited on-board batteries. Distinct from existing methods, this work presents a vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cooperative system for multiple UGVs. The proposed system harnesses the broad vision of UAV and operates in both general outdoor and global positioning system (GPS)-denied indoor environments. In sharp contrast to the conventional heuristic algorithms such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm and the Dijkstra methods, the proposed energy-efficient path planning for UGVs is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem by considering the collision-aware obstacle-avoidance. More specifically, the proposed path-planning scheme contains two stages, namely the semantic segmentation that localizes UGVs and obstacles in the environment by exploiting the wide-angle camera mounted on the UAV, followed by the trajectory generation in which a disciplined convex and concave programming (DCCP) algorithm is devised for the non-convex energy-minimization problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the UAV-UGV cooperative system and the proposed DCCP-based path-planning scheme.},

  abstract={A combination of several autonomous UAVs can be used to perform collaborative tasks. Such a combination is referred to as a swarm of drones. The use of multiple platforms can extend the system global capacities thanks to the resulting variety of embedded sensors and to information sharing. In this case, path planning and thus obstacles avoidance is still a major task. To deal with this issue, mobility models have to be implemented. Our contribution presented in this paper is a mobility model for swarms of UAVs based on the Artificial Potential Fields (APF) principle. In our model, the involved UAVs collaborate by sharing data about the obstacles that they detected. By doing so, a UAV which is not close enough to an obstacle to detect it thanks to its own sensors will still have the proper data to take this obstacle into account in its path planning. To validate our mobility strategies with realistic constraints we simulate the performances of existing sensors and transmitters, and consider real-world environment.},

  abstract={Aiming at the many-to-one mission planning problem in the case of UAV fault, a self-organizing solving method is designed. This method organically combines the situation assessment of single UAV with the collaborative optimization of multiple UAV. On the one hand, the situation assessment of single UAV is carried out based on Bayesian network, and the striking probability of each UAV is obtained. On the other hand, in order to solve the problem of multiple UAV cooperation, the improved discrete particle swarm optimization based mixed strategy (MSDPSO) is proposed. The algorithm has been improved in the following four aspects. Firstly, Sobol sequence is used to initialize the population to improve the coverage of solution space. Then, a nonlinear time-varying strategy is proposed to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Cauchy operator is also introduced to enhance the search space of discrete particle swarm optimization. At the same time, an adaptive cross learning strategy is proposed to enrich the diversity of the population, thereby improving the global optimization ability of the algorithm. In addition, the cubic spline interpolation is used to plan trajectory of UAV. Finally, improved discrete particle swarm optimization is used in three-dimensional space for simulation and comparison with both healthy and faulty UAV involved. Results show that the designed algorithm has significant improvement on solution optimality and convergence rate, which provides a theoretical basis for the application of multiple UAV collaborative task planning.},

  abstract={Autonomous exploration of unknown environments is a fundamental application in robotics society. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative exploration framework using a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and a UGV (unmanned ground vehicle). The work is motivated by the wish to combine advantages from different platforms to improve the efficiency in exploration. The ground vehicle carries a long-range laser scanner but travels slowly among obstacles, while the aerial vehicle has a downward-looking stereo camera and flies fast above obstacles. Our algorithm utilizes the complementary features of these two robots and conducts coordinated exploration, while is still flexible that each robot is able to carry out the task independently. In this paper, we combine frontier-based method and motion primitive for local exploration. Also, we adopt a traditional global fail-safe path planning to guide the vehicle to escape local minimum. The proposed framework is implemented on an autonomous collaborative aerial-ground platform.

  abstract={While autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attained a reputable stance in modern disaster response applications, their practical adoptions are impeded due to various constraints (e.g., requiring manual input, battery life). In this paper, we develop a novel spatiotemporal aware drone sensing system that is driven by harnessing social media signals, a process known as social sensing. Social sensing has emerged as a new sensing paradigm where humans act as "sensors" to report their observations about the physical world. However, maneuvering drones with "social signals" introduces a new realm of challenges. The first challenge is to drive the drones by leveraging noisy and unreliable social media signals. The second challenge is to optimize the drone deployment by exploring the highly dynamic and latent correlations among event locations. In this paper, we present CollabDrone that devises a new spatiotemporal correlation inference model and game-theoretic drone dispatching mechanism to address the above challenges. The evaluation results on a real-world case study show that CollabDrone significantly outperforms current drone and social sensing baselines in terms of accuracy and deadline hit rate.},

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown success in connecting rural and remote areas due to the high cost of deploying infrastructures like cellular network base stations and optical fiber connections in vast landscapes with sparse populations. The constrained energy of UAVs results in limited coverage area and flight time, which in turn reduces the potential of UAVs to provide task-oriented wireless communication links. In this article, we explore path optimization and transmission organization algorithms to minimize flight time and extend the range of UAVs performing collaborative federated learning (FL) among geographically dispersed nodes communicating through wireless connections offered by UAVs coupled with device-to-device (D2D) networks. The UAV orchestrates FL between spatially scattered homes via long-range radio wireless communication. We formulate the drone path optimization as a traveling salesman problem (TSP) and employ self-organizing maps (SOM) for path planning. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD)-based FL is used to reduce communication overhead for the resource-constrained UAV-IoT system. Experimental results demonstrate SOM’s ability to represent the topological structure of nodes and produce a cost-efficient Hamiltonian cycle, from which the drone path is derived. Our results demonstrate the communication efficiency and utility of KD-based FL compared to model-based FL methods. The proposed hybrid solution enables energy-constrained UAVs to perform FL over large areas leveraging a shared data set for KD and a SOM-based path optimization algorithm.},

  abstract={We describe a new framework for computer vision-based cooperative uav-assisted path planning for autonomous ground vehicles. In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have proved to be beneficial in many applications and services including path planning for autonomous vehicles. Most of the path planning applications assumes the availability of a digital map that allows a vehicle, be it ground or aerial, to navigate through landmarks and obstacles. However, in the scenario of unavailable maps especially during a natural disaster or a in war zone, it becomes extremely handy to have a drone that serves as an eye in the sky that explores the surrounding environment, and generates in real-time a trajectory guiding the vehicles on the ground around obstacles and obstructions. In this research, the UAV, serving as the eye in the sky is equipped with a camera that collects images of the surroundings and assists the ground vehicle in planning its path towards its final destination. Our approach includes the use of a vision-based algorithm which recognizes roads, pathways and obstacles, and calculates a path around them towards the destination. Simultaneously, the UAV keeps track of the ground vehicle progress towards the destination by monitoring and tracking its movement. The generation of the trajectory is based on an enhanced version of the A*algorithm. The experimental setup includes a robot and a drone, and an ultra-wide band (UWB) indoor positioning system which allows the vehicles to know their current location.},

  abstract={Aiming at the problems of distributed formation trajectory planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) in 3D space, a consensus algorithm for distributed cooperative formation trajectory planning is proposed by combining improved artificial potential field (IAPF) and consensus theory. Firstly, the second-order system dynamic model of the UAV is established. Secondly, the attractive potential field function and the repulsive potential field function containing the distance term are defined, and the potential field function between the UAVs considering the influence of communication is designed to realize the control objectives of UAV collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and smoothly reaching the target point. Then, a new consensus control protocol is designed by combining IAPF and consensus theory. UAVs can achieve convergence and consensus of relative distance and speed between the UAVs while maintaining the stability of the formation. Finally, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the stability of the system, and simulations are carried out through the formation of four UAVs. The results show that this method can achieve the control objectives of collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and the convergence of position and speed in the formation of trajectory planning.},

  abstract={In this work, a relay-based UAV-assisted cooperative communication for emergency applications is proposed for rural and semi-urban scenarios. 3-D deployment of multiple UAVs is resolved by jointly optimizing the height and transmit power of cluster UAVs and the optimal trajectory of relay UAVs is perfected by using the graph theory approach. While the majority of works in literature use UAVs as aerial base stations or as relays, this paper proposes to use UAVs as both relays and aerial base stations. Furthermore, this is one of the few works where UAVs are used as both static base stations (cluster UAVs) and mobile base stations (relay UAVs). The proposed 3-D deployment and trajectory planning algorithm is implemented at the ground base station (${\text {GBS}}$) and the resultant parameters will be distributed to cluster UAVs either directly or through relay UAVs. A four-step approach is proposed to solve the 2-D location coordinates of cluster UAVs, to find the location of the ${\text {GBS}}$, the power-height optimization of cluster UAVs, and to optimize the trajectory of relay UAVs. The number of users served, channel capacity achieved, power saved due to optimal deployment, latency reduced, and power saving by optimal trajectory are some of the performance metrics used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The simulation results are validated to show that the proposed solutions outperform existing similar approaches.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have numerous applications in reconnaissance, search, and rescue missions. However, searching underwater areas remains a challenge for UAVs. For antisubmarine search tasks, this article proposes using a mixed swarm of UAVs and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). To generate vehicle paths with the goal of minimizing the travel time while achieving complete coverage, a two-phase strategy is developed. In the first phase, optimal waypoints are determined to balance the task volume among the UAVs and USVs. A mapping model is constructed to represent the relationships between the different unmanned platforms and the mission environment. In the second phase, the search trajectory for each UAV/USV is generated by combining waypoint clustering and closed-loop trajectory generation. A detailed simulation study confirms the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed path planning method when applied to cross-domain swarms of different types and sizes for antisubmarine missions. In addition, the simulation results show that cross-domain cooperative planning for unmanned platforms may have advantages over single-domain planning in some scenarios},

  abstract={With the development of science and technology, robots have been widely used in smart cities. The traversability mapping of environment perception is the prerequisite for robots to perform tasks. To save the energy consumption of traversability mapping for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), we fusion a wide range of aerial images and a small amount of ground images to provide vision for UGV. Current map fusion methods are usually constrained by homogeneous model of robotic systems and lack of diverse sensors. As a result, they cannot work well in heterogeneous collaborative robotic systems that consist of aerial and ground robots. In this paper, we use heterogeneous robot systems, including UGV and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to build an occupancy grid map that can be used for navigation. To fuse sensor data of different types, we propose a Collaborative Map Fusion algorithm based on Multi-task Gaussian Process Classification (MTGPC) using heterogeneous robotic systems. Besides, probabilistic model is exploited in traversability mapping, so the active perception can be used to build the map efficiently. Our system is tested in real scenes and can achieve an accuracy of more than 70%. The map fusion using active perception is better than map fusion using random strategy in terms of speed and accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work that can build the occupancy grid map using sparse data points sampled from aerial images and ground lidar map.},

  abstract={In maritime data collection scenarios, achieving the rapid delivery of data from buoy sensor nodes to the shipboard station is a challenging issue. Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology to facilitate the transfer of data from buoy sensor nodes, it becomes feasible to significantly reduce the latency generated in the transmission process. Therefore, we introduce a UAV-assisted maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) data collection mechanism based on relay cooperation. In this mechanism, through relay transmissions among UAVs, it avoids UAVs located distant from the shipboard station from having to traverse extensive distances in order to offload data to the shipboard station. Based on this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based cooperative data collection (DCDC) scheme. In this scheme, firstly, we select the convergence node in charge of forwarding the data from buoy sensor nodes to the passing UAVs. Next, to achieve dynamic adaptation of the task areas for UAVs, we propose an adaptive partition algorithm based on virtual moving points. Subsequently, to establish relay transmission links between UAVs, we present a routing algorithm based on matching game theory. Finally, to reduce time costs in delivering collected data to the shipboard station, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) plan the flight paths of UAVs. Additionally, we introduce virtual waypoints in the path planning algorithm, which enables that paired UAVs can high-efficiently perform data forwarding through encounter opportunities. Extensive simulation experiments have demonstrated that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of system Age of Information (AoI).},

  abstract={Autonomous aircraft path planning has demonstrated significant potential in various applications of the Internet of Aerial Things. However, static coverage solutions are inadequate for continuously moving aerial vehicles, such as fixed-wing aircraft and low-earth orbit satellites. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an algorithm capable of planning paths for dynamically moving aircraft. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic coverage path planning algorithm tailored for multi-airship formations that adhere to the dynamic constraints of stratospheric airships. The proposed framework leverages reinforcement learning to accumulate experience through exploration, storing it in an experience pool. This facilitates swift updates to the networks of each agent through semi-centralized exploration and centralized experience playback. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm assigns distinct rewards based on different task stages, enhancing the agent's suitability for area coverage studies.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided short-packet transmissions have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting mission-critical applications in future mobile communication networks. However, the security issues raised by the open nature of the wireless transmission deserve attention, especially when confronted with cooperative wardens and eavesdroppers. To this end, we consider a new framework for an energy-efficient design of UAV-aided short-packet transmission systems against cooperative hostile detection and eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the false rate of the cooperative hostile detection is first derived by utilizing the likelihood ratio test and the bivariate Gaussian distribution property. Then, we formulate a problem to maximize the minimum covert secrecy energy efficiency (MCSEE) by jointly optimizing the user association, UAV power control, and UAV three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. We propose a penalty-based dual-loop iterative optimization algorithm to tackle this complex problem suboptimally with the aid of auxiliary penalty variables, where the communication resource scheduling, the UAV trajectory planning, and the auxiliary penalty variables are optimized in the inner loop. In particular, the intractable joint UAV power control and 3D trajectory design sub-problem is suboptimally addressed by introducing slack variables and employing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The penalty factor is updated in the outer loop. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed solution to several benchmarks.},

  abstract={For multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing aerial search-attack tasks, there is a tradeoff between maximizing total benefit and minimizing consumption under the validity of constraints. This article proposes a dynamic discrete pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm to handle cooperative search-attack mission planning for UAVs, which integrates the centralized task assignment and distributed path generation aspects of the problem. Besides, a solution acceptance strategy is proposed to avoid frequent task switching. To design a reasonable objective function, the probability map is constructed and updated by Bayes formula to guide the following search motion, and a response threshold sigmoid model is adopted for target allocation during executing attack. Moreover, the flyable trajectories are generated by B-spline curves based on the simplified waypoints. Finally, numerical experiments prove that the proposed methods can provide feasible solutions for multiple UAVs considering different scenarios, such as the absence or presence of threats and insufficient resources. The results also show that the solution acceptance strategy is effective to improve performance. Moreover, the extensible mission planning system also integrates with an interactive 3D visualization simulation module, where the multi-UAV coordinated flight processes are demonstrated dynamically.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel solution to address the challenges in achieving energy efficiency and cooperation for collision avoidance in UAV swarms. The proposed method combines Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques. APF provides environmental awareness and implicit coordination to UAVs, while PSO searches for collision-free and energy-efficient trajectories for each UAV in a decentralized manner under the implicit coordination. This decentralized approach is achieved by minimizing a novel cost function that leverages the advantages of the active contour model from image processing. Additionally, future trajectories are predicted by approximating the minima of the novel cost function using calculus of variation, which enables proactive actions and defines the initial conditions for PSO. We propose a two-branch trajectory planning framework that ensures UAVs only change altitudes when necessary for energy considerations. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in various situations.},

  abstract={With the continuous application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the field of national defense and civil use, the UAV cluster system in which multiple UAVs cooperate to perform tasks has become a key research in many countries. This paper focuses on the problem of multi-UAV's Coverage Path Planning (mCPP) to exploit all points of interests within an area based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), where each UAV starts with a random position and carries a camera during the mission. There have been a number of optimal algorithms proposed for the coverage path planning of single UAV, however, it is under-explored for multiple UAVs. As such, we leverage Deep reinforcement learning with Double Q-learning Networks (DDQN) to learn a global optimal control policy for a team of UAVs under certain power constraints to cooperate effectively to explore a wider area. Regarding the task area as a 2D plane, we divide it into a collection of uniform grid cells, which represent a section of the environment. The camera field of view of each UAV covers a cell area underneath the UAV. Simulation results demonstrate that wherever the start positions are, the UAV cluster can fully cover the whole task area under the energy constraints and achieve autonomous collaboration. The proposed method has great potential in applying to dynamic environment.},

  abstract={When multiple mobile robots (e.g., robotic equipment and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) are deployed to work cooperatively, it is usually difficult to jointly optimize the algorithms involving the following two aspects: finding optimal paths and maintaining reliable network connectivity. This is due to the fact that both these objectives require the manipulation of sensors' physical locations. We introduce a new relay-assisted communication model to decouple these two aspects so that each one can be optimized independently. However, using additional relay nodes is at the expense of an increased number of transmissions and reduced spectrum efficiency. Theoretical results based on mutual information and average data rate of the model reveal that such drawbacks can be compensated if the sensor nodes are carefully arranged into groups. Based on these results, we further propose a pairing strategy to maximize the spectrum efficiency gain. Simulation experiments have confirmed the performance of this strategy in terms of improved efficiency. We provide a simple example to demonstrate the application of this model in cooperative sensing scenarios where multiple UAVs are deployed to explore an unknown area.},

  abstract={Multi-UAV collaborative target allocation (MUCTA) refers to the reasonable allocation of limited UAV resources according to the location of each UAV and target point in a complex simulation environment, so that the UAV population can avoid the threat source and effectively attack target points in different locations at the same time. During the planning process, large-scale UAVs and target points greatly increase allocation conflicts and the iterative calculations of the planning system lead to a less efficient planning system. To improve the efficiency of multi-UAV collaborative target allocation, this work proposes a Differential Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Two-Way Knowledge Transfer (TWKT- DE). Firstly, the constraints of UAVs are linearly weighted and transformed into a new objective function. The value of violated constraints is an important evaluation index of UAV allocation conflict. This method can effectively reduce the allocation conflict between UAVs. Secondly, the initial UAV allocation scheme is obtained by the DE algorithm and defined as reference knowledge, and the selection probability between tasks updates the UAV allocation scheme. Finally, the method effectively improves the efficiency of the planning system search by guiding the search direction of the planning system through the two-way transfer mechanism and reducing the redundancy of the allocation scheme. Experiments 1 and 2 validate the proposed algorithm, respectively, and the results verify the outstanding performance of TWKT-DE in dealing with multi-UAV collaborative target allocation with low allocation conflicts, high collaborative capability, and high planning efficiency.},

  abstract={The rapid development of UAV technology has given birth to the demand of multi-UAV cooperative operation. However, in the face of diverse tasks and complex environment, the traditional task allocation and planning methods are limited. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-UAV cooperative task assignment and planning model based on fuzzy clustering algorithm. Through fuzzy clustering algorithm, we can deal with the uncertainty and diversity of tasks more flexibly and improve the intelligence and adaptability of the system. In the task assignment stage of the model, fuzzy clustering algorithm is introduced to identify the similarity between tasks, thus forming fuzzy task groups. The task assignment probability is determined by the membership degree of task and cluster, and the most suitable UAV is found for each task. In the path planning stage, the model uses the clustering results for intelligent path planning, fully considers the relationship between tasks, and optimizes the route of UAV. Through simulation experiments, we verify the excellent performance of the model in task allocation accuracy and system performance. The model based on fuzzy clustering shows better adaptability in the face of different task types and environmental changes.

  abstract={This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) motion planning and control scheme for an automated firefighting system. The proposed automated firefighting system consists of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) cooperating to detect, localize, and handle the wildfire. In this automated cooperative framework, the UGVs have to reach to the fire (target) in an optimal way, optimal in the sense that the operation time and fuel consumption are minimized. Meanwhile, the UAVs gather and report the localization data to the system. Furthermore, the UAVs motions are intended to reduce the system uncertainty. The proposed motion planning scheme is designed to handle various sources of uncertainty as well as environment constraints through incorporating them to the conventional nonlinear model predictive control. Numerical simulations have been carried out to study the performance of the proposed MPC motion planning and control scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to design an optimal trajectory while handling the system uncertainties and constraints.},

  abstract={The navigation relayed by multiple stations (NRMS) is a cooperative navigation technology which relies on multiple stations to guide an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sequentially. The stations which are scattered in different spatial locations provide the navigation information or the control command for the UAV. This paper addresses the optimal path planning problem for a UAV navigated by the NRMS technology to intercept a moving target. This problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem which involves four constraints: the navigation range constraint, the navigation handover constraint, the maximum turning angle constraint, and the time difference constraint. The first two constraints distinguish our problem from other path planning problems. A differential evolution based (DE-based) path planning algorithm is proposed to find a feasible and high-quality path for the UAV. The numerical stability and effectiveness of the DE-based path planning algorithm are demonstrated by computational experiments.},

  abstract={A multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided secure communication network is studied, where multiple information UAVs carrying temporary aerial base stations transmit confidential information to multiple authorized receivers (ARs), and a jammer UAV is employed to send artificial noise to multiple unauthorized receivers (URs) for mitigating information leakage. Some practical constrains including the inter-UAV interference among the information UAVs and the jammer UAV, the maximal available propulsion energy at UAVs, and the curvature radius limitations of UAVs' trajectories are concurrently taken into account. In order to maximize the minimum secrecy rate among the ARs, the AR scheduling, the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs are jointly optimized by formulating a multi-variable optimization problem. To solve the non-convex problem efficiently, we present a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based approach, where the penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is designed to optimize the AR scheduling, and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs. The complexity of the presented BCD-based approach is analyzed, which achieves polynomial complexity. Simulation results show that imposing curvature radius limitations on the UAVs' trajectory design is effective to avoid sharp turning of UAVs. Moreover, as curvature radius increases, the system max-min secrecy rate decreases. Besides, the secrecy rate performance of the system can be enhanced by exploiting one jammer UAV to interfere with the URs.},

  abstract={When applied in building rescue, forest search and other missions, UAV swarms often encounter challenges such as narrow space constraints and dynamic changes of obstacles, which leads to internal conflicts in the swarm or cause system chaos due to avoiding dynamic obstacles during the execution of tasks. These rigorous characteristics of the actual application scenarios and tasks always make global searching difficult to be optimized and local obstacle avoidance into deadlock. To solve the above problems, this paper introduces a hierarchical online collaborative planning framework inspired by global spatio-temporal paths. In order to reduce the solution complexity while dissolving the overall conflict, global rough searching is conducted for initial spatio-temporal guidance path. To overcome dynamic obstacles without affecting the system internal harmony, online conflict-trend-based clustering co-optimization inspired by the initial path is performed to achieve obstacle avoidance while improving scalability. Experimental tests were conducted in simulation environments with narrow pipelines and dynamic obstacles with comparison to current mainstream centralized and distributed methods. The results demonstrate that our work can generate smoother and safer trajectories with higher success rate in the constraint-rich dynamic environments.},

  abstract={Aiming at the problem that multi-UAV provide reconnaissance services for multiple users at the same time, a new cooperative reconnaissance planning algorithm is proposed. The centralized task assignment strategy based on multi-user demand aggregation is adopted to avoid repeated reconnaissance of the same target. The information sharing strategy based on the demand of a single user is adopted to complete the reconnaissance information of a single UAV to avoid repeated visits of multi-UAV to the same user. An efficient multi-UAV cooperative path planning algorithm is designed to minimize the total energy consumption of multi-UAV. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional UAV reconnaissance method based on single user demand, the proposed method performs better in terms of energy saving, and with the increase of the information overlap rate and the number of users, the energy-saving effect is more significant.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are surging in popularity as a result of the versatility of their usage. Research has focused on a variety of applications by UAV groups including surveillance, target tracking, network coverage and mapping of various areas or incidents. Autonomous UAVs can be utilized to perform tasks which may be potentially dangerous for human intervention. Earlier work has shown that a group of UAVs can successfully circumscribe a plume of hazardous contaminants in the air and map the boundary of such a spill. In this paper, we show that this idea can be extended to plumes which contain elements heavier than air and, as such, fall to the ground such that they approximately form a spherical dome. Mapping such a boundary is challenging because UAVs need to follow the plume as close to the ground as possible without crashing. Our results prove that a UAV platoon can successfully communicate and coordinate amongst themselves in order to surround such a leak.},

  abstract={In event or disaster scenarios where network communication is jammed, it is important to provide stable network service to users within a reasonable amount of time. We propose a path planning algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to serve network traffic in hotspot areas using spatio-temporal information about requests among the region of interest (RoI). The main task of a UAV is to provide communication services to users, while preparing for future hotspots. We propose a simple yet efficient trajectory design consisting of two phases: 1) targeting traffic for a single UAV, and 2) cooperative targeting for multiple UAVs. First, each UAV selects a long-term target considering future traffic and then a short-term target considering the present traffic. When UAVs encounter other UAVs, a cooperative targeting phase ensures UAVs serve traffic in different locations or with different statuses. Our trajectory design enables a UAV to construct its own path for a continuous UAV-enabled network. Simulation and real-world dataset-based experiments confirmed that our targeting scheme provides sufficient network service in a reasonable time, with an average service rate factor of up to 0.85, and an average service completion time relative to the deadline of up to 0.23. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm provides more stable performance compared to other existing algorithms.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms must exploit machine learning (ML) in order to execute various tasks ranging from coordinated trajectory planning to cooperative target recognition. However, due to the lack of continuous connections between the UAV swarm and ground base stations (BSs), using centralized ML will be challenging, particularly when dealing with a large volume of data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to implement distributed federated learning (FL) algorithms within a UAV swarm that consists of a leading UAV and several following UAVs. Each following UAV trains a local FL model based on its collected data and then sends this trained local model to the leading UAV who will aggregate the received models, generate a global FL model, and transmit it to followers over the intra-swarm network. To identify how wireless factors, like fading, transmission delay, and UAV antenna angle deviations resulting from wind and mechanical vibrations, impact the performance of FL, a rigorous convergence analysis for FL is performed. Then, a joint power allocation and scheduling design is proposed to optimize the convergence rate of FL while taking into account the energy consumption during convergence and the delay requirement imposed by the swarm's control system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the FL convergence analysis and show that the joint design strategy can reduce the number of communication rounds needed for convergence by as much as 35% compared with the baseline design.},

  abstract={Specialized robots, such as legged robots and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are commonly regarded as effective platforms for aiding in search and rescue (SAR) missions. However, existing approaches often decouple the tasks between UAVs and legged robots, for instance, using UAVs for mapping and legged robots for operation. Such feature hinders the realization of collaborative advantages and consequently reduces task completion efficiency. This letter proposes a perception-planning framework for collaborative SAR missions involving UAVs and legged robots. The framework primarily utilizes UAVs to efficiently search for target objects in unknown environments, while also determining a feasible path for the legged robots to reach the targets. More specifically, the UAV employs an optimized frontier-based exploration method to explore unknown environments. Simultaneously, a depth-first reachable search tree is utilized to swiftly assess the traversability of the guided path of the legged robot, thereby accelerating the exploration process. After locating the target, the method further constrains the exploration area based on permissible ellipses until an the shortest path is found. The proposed approach is evaluated through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios and the results demonstrate that our approach exhibits significantly higher exploration efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, reducing completion times in SAR tasks by over 18.3%.},

Secondly, time error signal was obtained from real time-to-go and the estimated time-to-go by adopting a simple online time-to-go estimation method.

This article studies the energy-efficient cooperative strategy of rechargeable multi-UAVs for providing seamless coverage and long-term information services for IoT nodes. Considering the limited cruising duration of the UAV, multiple rechargeable UAVs are capable of constructing a closed chain for the sake of alternately supporting IoT nodes. Moreover, a joint IoT node assignment and UAV configuration optimization problem is proposed in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the system. Since the proposed problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we divide it into three subproblems, namely, node assignment scheduling, UAV trajectory planning, and transmit power control. By exploiting sequential convex optimization techniques, we reformulate the nonconvex subproblems into three convex optimization problems which can be solved within the polynomial time. A block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving these energy-efficiency oriented subproblems. Finally, the simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract={UAV-AGV multi-agent system is attracting the mobile robotics research community due to its applications in several engineering disciplines. It's a heterogeneous combination of UAV and AGV. Collaborative kinematics between both agents is necessity of the system for better utilization of independent capabilities. Vision-based method is most focused in the literature to build the collaboration between the agents which is of great use in the GPS denied environments. One of the collaborative tasks of UAV is to approach the AGV and hover over it at certain altitude. A trajectory tracking technique in the image frame is developed for the task in the present work. UAV detects the static target/AGV in the image plane and plans 3- dimensional trajectory to reach and hover at a desired depth from it. Minimum acceleration trajectories are designed using position and apparent size of the target in the image plane. Sliding mode control theory is applied for designing the controllers for approach, depth motion of UAV and validated with the simulations. The proposed image plane-based trajectory tracking technique is further validated in the Gazebo simulation environment. Simulation results shows that the method is useful in GPS denied environments for the UAV to plan its collaborative navigation in the image frame for smoothly reaching a desired position from the target/AGV.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks, and determining collision-free trajectories for multiple UAVs while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) is a challenging task. In this paper, we consider non-cooperative multi-UAV scenarios, in which multiple UAVs need to fly from initial locations to destinations, while satisfying collision avoidance, wireless connectivity, and kinematic constraints. We aim to find trajectories for the UAVs with the goal to minimize their mission completion time. We first formulate the multi-UAV trajectory optimization problem as a sequential decision making problem. We, then, propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is developed to obtain values given the agent’s joint state (including the agent’s information, the nearby agents’ observable information, and the locations of the nearby GBSs). A signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-prediction neural network is also designed, using accumulated SINR measurements obtained when interacting with the cellular network, to map the GBSs’ locations into the SINR levels in order to predict the UAV’s SINR. Numerical results show that with the value network and SINR-prediction network, real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed in various environments with high success rate.},

  abstract={Multi-UAV cooperative formation flying has significant advantages in broadening the scope of UAV operations and improving combat effectiveness. How to realize the cooperative path planning of multi-UAV is an open issue. In order to solve the search performance degradation as dimension increases, a strategy of multi-UAV cooperative path planning based on Cooperative Coevolution Particle Swarm Optimization (CCPSO) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the initial Dubins path is generated for each UAV in the formation, of which the longest one is selected as the reference path. Intermediate waypoints are designed to modify the initial paths to avoid collisions with obstacles. Then, CCPSO algorithm is applied to optimize path parameters and adjust the path length to be equal to the reference path to ensure time coordination. Collision avoidance between UAVs is achieved in the collaborative evaluation phase. Finally, an formation rendezvous example and comparison with CCGA are given to explain the validity and excellent search ability of the proposed method.},

  abstract={This paper implements and demonstrates an optimal positioning and trajectory planning algorithm and framework for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to improve the communication network of static ground nodes with unknown locations. In particular, a two-stage framework is proposed. In the first phase, UAVs first localize the ground nodes using received signal strength measurements. Next, the UAVs transition to acting as relays between the ground nodes once their locations have been determined, within a certain level of tolerance. In the first stage, the UAVs assigned to the search task cooperatively plan their trajectories in order to maximize the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix for all of the ground nodes. In the second stage, the UAVs assigned to the relay task cooperatively plan their trajectories in order to minimize the cost of the minimum spanning tree of the graph that models the overall network. In both stages, the UAVs plan in a distributed manner with a receding horizon approach. A discrete genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal control inputs while considering the collision avoidance and dynamic constraints of the fixed-wing UAVs. The UAVs switch from one task to another when their base station determines that the estimate for a ground node has reached an acceptable level of uncertainty and that the ground node is disconnected from the network. Demonstrations of this framework with a single and multiple targets and UAVs are presented along with analysis of the performance of the trajectory planning in improving estimates of target locations and in improving the connectivity of the ground network.},

  abstract={To solve the problem of cooperative target tracking considering ground moving-targets and threats, a novel approach for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) cooperative target tracking using sparse A* search and Standoff tracking algorithms is proposed. Firstly, sparse A* search algorithm is introduced to generate multiple paths for UAVs subject to the threats and UAV kinematics constraints. And multi-UAV rendezvous at a predefined formation nearby the moving-target. Then, considering the target tracking distance and relative phase angle constraints, the Standoff tracking algorithm is utilized to generate cooperative tracking paths. Simulation results demonstrate that the multi-UAV cooperative target tracking method can effectively avoid threats and achieve persistent moving-target tracking and monitoring in the mission areas.},

  abstract={The timely detection of targets in uncharted territory, followed by tracking and monitoring of the targets are an important part of ocean monitoring activities. The cross-domain monitoring approach refers to the way of monitoring target in all directions in the sky and sea. Most of the existing studies are based on collaborative monitoring within the same domain. Cross-domain monitoring complements effectively the existing monitoring methods, which collects richer and more comprehensive data. In this paper, the monitoring process is divided into two stages: target search and target tracking. Autonomous underwater vehicle(AUV), unmanned surface vehicle(USV) and Unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) are used as research objects of the collaborative algorithm in cross-domain monitoring. The cost function and status of each vehicle are defined. The collaborative target tracking algorithm is designed by Q-learning. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by simulation. It proves that the method used in this paper is feasible and can satisfy various constraints.},

  abstract={Flying Ad-Hoc Network (FANET) is a special type of Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) which consists of multiple networked Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Compared to traditional target search using a single UAV, multiple cooperative UAVs within a FANET have the potential to accomplish this work more efficiently, and multi-UAV cooperative target search has attracted increasing research attention in recent years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation on efficient multi-UAV cooperative search on moving targets. More specifically, we propose an adaptive Track-Explore adjustment strategy to dynamically assign the search task of each UAV at each time-step. Meanwhile, to improve the search performance, we introduce a novel on-line path planning method to guide the flying decision of each UAV. The proposed search framework is compared with random walk method and an ideal (not achievable) state in different scenarios, and the simulation results show that our FATES framework works efficiently on multiple moving targets search tasks with great adaptability and robustness.},

  abstract={In the disaster rescue scene, due to the limited capabilities of UAVs, many relief operations that mere UAVs are not enough to deal with. This paper presents a human and UAV cooperative area search planning framework to help people and UAV share information during disaster search process and collaboratively plan the path of UAV. In order to minimize the uncertain environment in the search area, an improved algorithm based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) is proposed for UAV area search through the introduction of environmental uncertainty information. The Bayesian estimation is introduced into the UAV module for inferring the goal area that human plans to search. By combining the inferred human goal with a modified RRT-based algorithm, the UAV is able to intelligently design search path to assistant human in seeking the goal area while observing the district that human cannot reach. Simulation results demonstrate that the method is effective.},

  abstract={With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT), compute-intensive and latency-critical applications continue to emerge. However, IoT devices in isolated locations have insufficient energy storage as well as computing resources and may fall outside the service range of ground communication networks. To overcome the constraints of communication coverage and terminal resource, this paper proposes a multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted air-ground collaborative edge computing network model, which comprises associated UAVs, auxiliary UAVs, ground user devices (GDs), and base stations (BSs), intending to minimize the overall system energy consumption. It delves into task offloading, UAV trajectory planning and edge resource allocation, which thus is classified as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. Worse still, the coupling of long-term task queuing delay and short-term offloading decision makes it challenging to address the original issue directly. Therefore, we employ Lyapunov optimization to transform it into two sub-problems. The first involves task offloading for GDs, trajectory optimization for associated UAVs as well as auxiliary UAVs, which is tackled using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), while the second deals with task partitioning and computing resource allocation, which we address via convex optimization. Through numerical simulations, we verify that the proposed approach outperforms other benchmark methods regarding overall system energy consumption.},

Since multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance task decision making problem is not only a complicated multi-objective optimization and decision problem with multi-constraint, but also a large-scale coordination control problem. We construct the mathematical model according to the maximization of reconnaissance gains of all task areas for multi-UAVs. By balancing the reconnaissance gains among the multi-task areas in order to generate a plan that is efficient for the reconnaissance mission, the Lingo software is adopted to settle this scheduling problem. The numerical result shows that we can obtain the optimal solution for the multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance decision-making problem by Lingo software efficiently.},

  abstract={Recently, with the rapid development of intensive corridors of transmission lines, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) now meets new challenges in the inspection tasks of transmission lines. Although previous studies have achieved remarkable success in this field, they focused on the tasks of single UAV automatic inspection and UAV path planning, without considering multi-UAV collaborative inspection tasks. To solve these problems, we propose a novel improved genetic algorithm with multi-level chromosome hybrid coding and dual population selection, which is called CH&DS-GA. Specifically, based on the multi-traveling salesman problem (M-TSP), we established the multi-UAV traveling salesman problem model with charging stations (MU-TSP-C) and encouraged UAVs to select tasks adaptively according to the present power. In small-scale experiments, the CH&DS-GA can obtain approximate optimal solutions with little running time; in large-scale experiments, the relationship between the solution time and tasks are approximately linear as the tasks increase. The results demonstrate that the CH&DS-GA has superior performance.},

  pages={3374-3383},
  abstract={In this paper, we address the multiple quadrotor UAVs trajectory planning optimization problem for large-scale, persistent, high-depth visual coverage tasks in three-dimensional (3-D) terrain environment. To minimize the overall energy expenditure of the UAVs for accomplishing a task, we set up an air-to-ground collaborative system which introduces base stations to hold and recharge UAVs. The system is formulated as an integer programming, and solved by a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning trajectory planning algorithm (RL-TP), in which the paths are obtained by reinforcement learning method, and then the trajectories are obtained by Bézier curve method. Both simulation and physical experiments show that RL-TP can effectively improve the efficiency and persistence of aerial visual coverage task. Note to Practitioners—While the multi-rotor UAV has been an important means for field monitoring, it suffers the problem of short battery life a lot. To make it more efficient and persistent, we use multiple UAVs and introduce ground base stations to charge the UAVs. The scenario is formulated as an air-to-ground collaborative system, and the motion planning strategy is to minimize the energy consumption. We propose a hierarchical collaborative coverage reinforcement learning trajectory planning algorithm (RL-TP) to solve it. We carry out both simulation and physical field experiments, and compare RL-TP with other popular methods. The experimental results show that the system is feasible and RL-TP performs well in both time efficiency and energy consumption. In future research, we will introduce unmanned ground vehicles to replace the stationary ground base stations to make the air-to-ground collaborative system more powerful and flexible.},

  year={2023},
  volume={24},

  pages={9627-9641},
  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively applied to goods delivery and in-situ sensing. It becomes increasingly probable that multiple UAVs are delivering goods and carrying out sensing tasks at the same time. The destinations of the UAVs are usually required to jointly design their trajectories and sensing selections, leading to privacy concerns for the UAVs. This paper presents a new game-theoretic routing framework for joint goods delivery and sensing of multiple cellular-connected UAVs, where the UAVs minimize their energy consumption and connectivity outage, maximize their sensing reward, and ensure timely goods delivery and trajectory privacy by optimizing their trajectories and sensing task selections in a decentralized manner. The key idea is that we unify routing and sensing in a single task selection process, which is further transformed into routing on a task-time graph. Another important aspect is that we design a non-cooperative potential game for the routing on the task-time graph. A distributed strategy is developed, where each UAV only reports its sensing task selections and withholds its destination information and its best response produced by the Bellman-Ford algorithm. By this means, the destination and trajectory privacy of the UAVs are protected. Simulations show that the new game-theoretic approach can ensure timely delivery and achieve close-to-optimal solutions with significantly lower complexity compared to a centralized brute-force approach.},

Upon detecting fire in high-risk zones, the UAV not only alerts the nearby residents but also formulates an evacuation path to safe zones. Concurrently, unmanned vehicles, guided by these UAVs and leveraging the reactive algorithm, are dispatched for victim retrieval, ensuring efficient navigation around obstacles. This dual-system response is framed as an optimization problem. This approach melds advanced fire modeling with state-of-the-art navigation for an improved bushfire response strategy.},

The considered multi-UAV non-cooperative scenarios involve random number of other UAVs in addition to the typical UAV, and UAVs do not communicate with each other. We translate the problem into an Markov decision process (MDP). Dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) is proposed to learn the decision making policy for the typical UAV, without any prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., channel propagation model and locations of the obstacles) and other UAVs (e.g., their missions, movements, and policies). Numerical results demonstrate that real-time navigation can be efficiently performed with high success rate, high data collection rate, and low collision rate.},

Further, a variable airspeed controller is used to maintain the UAV cooperative formation flight in a circular orbit, and an adaptive estimate is introduced to ensure the flight-stability of a circular orbit in the case of unknown wind and moving targets. In the process of the UAV formation tracking motion targets, we use a variable airspeed controller to achieve the desired angular spacing. In this paper, the designed controller laws are decentralized based on the local information. Meanwhile, the simulation shows that the designed controller has a good the flight-stability in the process of tracking motion target.},

  abstract={Multi-UAV collaborative path planning (MUCPP) is a complex multi-objective optimization problem. Compared with the traditional path planning algorithms, stochastic heuristic algorithm (SHA) can solve this kind of problem more efficiently. In this paper, we first introduce several widely used UAV path planning algorithms. Then, recent works on MUCPP based on SHA are reviewed, where the feature, improvement and application, merits and demerits of those proposed algorithms are discussed. Finally, the challenges of path planning for multiple UAVs are put forward and the future development trend is prospected from the aspects of theoretical and applied research.},

  abstract={Collaborative air-ground robotic system has recently emerged as an important research area and shown great potential in many practical applications of smart cities. This work aims to use such system to transform the aerial images from UAVs into terrain map exploited by UGVs to perform ground path planning or navigation tasks. We propose a novel GAN-based active terrain mapping (GAN-ATM) algorithm which integrates Active Learning (AL) strategy into Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to build the terrain map efficiently with a very limited number of labeled data. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest predictive accuracy of 90.35%. Due to a more accurate terrain map, the UAV using GAN-ATM can plan the shortest trajectory among all existing counterparts.},

  abstract={This paper uses a team of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to cooperatively search, an area of interest that contains regions of opportunity and regions of potential hazard. The objective of the UAV team is to visit as many opportunities as possible, while avoiding as many hazards as possible. To enable cooperation, the UAVs are constrained to stay within communication range of one another. Collision avoidance is also required. Algorithms for team-optimal and individually-optimal/team-suboptimal solutions are developed and their computational complexity compared. Simulation results demonstrating the feasibility of the cooperative search algorithms are presented.},

  abstract={Path planning of the unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) under the condition of uncertainty of environment remains a challenge because of many constraints. In this paper, a multiple unmanned combat aerial vehicle (multi-UCAV) cooperative autonomous attack path planning method under complex and uncertain environment is put forward. A general framework of multi-UCAV cooperative combat and autonomous attack is designed. Then, the relative movement situation of the UCAV formation is studied and the task assignment model for attacking multi-target is established. On this basis, an improved ant colony algorithm (ACA) is used to solve the corresponding optimal problem. By taking the three degrees of freedom model of UCAV as a core and considering various constraints such as aerodynamic characteristics, thrust variation, target projection area and threat area, an accurate cooperative autonomous attack path planning model for multi-UCAV is built and an improved rolling pseudospectral method(RPM) is applied to calculate the optimal trajectory from the current location to the launch acceptable region. Simulation results show that the proposed ACA and RPM can deal with the task assignment and path planning of multi-UCAV effectively, and they have higher precision and better real-time compared with some existed methods.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) swarm is an organic whole formed by a certain number of drones cooperating with each other. It has more advanced and diversified functions and can complete more comprehensive and complex tasks. UAV swarms currently are faced many problems such as low intelligence, rough cooperative control algorithms, and inaccurate behavior prediction. Simulation modeling plays an important role in the research of these critical technologies. Traditional simulation modeling has serious simulation error accumulation and data lag. We propose the design of parallel simulation system for UAV swarms. We complete the related work of dynamic generation of simulation entities, state synchronization between simulation entities and UAVs, and ultra-real-time simulation. Through the performance test, the experimental results prove that UAV swarm parallel simulation system (UAVSPSS) has the ability to dynamically generate the simulation entity in a short time and complete the state synchronization of the simulation entity in a limited time. These results show that the UAV swarms parallel simulation system provides stability of simulation errors and real-time synchronization of data.},
