A hierarchical UAV deployment strategy that facilitates cooperative trajectory planning, ensuring timely data collection and transmission while minimizing energy consumption is proposed. By formulating the inter-UAV network path planning problem as a Markov decision process, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is applied to enable real-time decision making that accounts for dynamic environmental changes, obstacles, and UAV battery constraints. The extensive simulation results, conducted in both rural and urban scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of employing a memory access approach within the DQN framework, significantly reducing energy consumption up to 33.25% in rural settings and 74.20% in urban environments compared to non-memory approaches. By integrating AoI considerations with energy-efficient UAV control, this work offers a robust solution for maintaining fresh data in critical applications, such as disaster response, where ground-based communication infrastructures are compromised. The use of replay memory approach, particularly the online history approach, proves crucial in adapting to changing conditions and optimizing UAV operations for both data freshness and energy consumption. © 2024 The Author(s).

Aiming to reduce the influence of non-complete ground threat information on UAH path planning, a ground threat prediction-based path planning method is proposed based on artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm by collaborative thinking strategy. Firstly, a dynamic threat distribution probability model is developed based on the characteristics of typical ground threats. The dynamic no-fly zone of the UAH is simulated and established by calculating the distribution probability of ground threats in real time. Then, a dynamic path planning method for UAH is designed in complex environment based on the real-time prediction of ground threats. By adding the collision warning mechanism to the path planning model, the flight path could be dynamically adjusted according to changing no-fly zones. Furthermore, a hybrid enhanced ABC algorithm is proposed based on collaborative thinking strategy. The proposed algorithm applies the leader-member thinking mechanism to guide the direction of population evolution, and reduces the negative impact of local optimal solutions caused by collaborative learning update strategy, which makes the optimization performance of ABC algorithm more controllable and efficient. Finally, simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ground threat prediction path planning method. © 2023 China Ordnance Society","Collaborative thinking; Ground threat prediction; Hybrid enhanced; Path planning; UAH","Dynamics; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Optimization; Probability distributions; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Artificial bees; Bee colony algorithms; Collaborative thinking; Distribution probability; Ground threat prediction; Hybrid enhanced; Path planning method; Prediction-based; Threat prediction; Unmanned autonomous helicopters; Motion planning","M.

The modeling of collaborative combat missions and the efficient solution of large-scale problems are the key issues. With the time, path cost, and reconnaissance benefit as the objective functions, considering the constraints such as the endurance of unmanned platforms, a multi-objective programming model for the reconnaissance missions of an air-ground heterogeneous unmanned system is constructed. Aiming at the urban combat environments with multiple threat zones, considering the path safety and timeliness of unmanned platform missions, the improved A* algorithm path planning strategies for unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles are proposed. Aiming at the problem that the optimization effect of snake optimizer (SO) is unstable and easy to fall into local optimal solutions, an improved snake optimizer (IMSO) is proposed by combining the particle swarm algorithm and the genetic algorithm. Simulation verification and comparative analysis with existing algorithms are carried out by using Python language to verify the feasibility of the model and the superiority of the algorithm. Solving 10 tasks independently under three different task loads from small to large, the average objective function values of IMSO are 100.11%, 108.99%, and 110.01% of SO, respectively. It can be seen that IMSO can jump out of local optima multiple times, and the stability and final fitness values of the algorithm are better than SO, and is more superior in solving the larger-scale problems. © 2024 Acta Simulata Systematica Sinica.

Each suspicious link is comprised of a UAV (transmitter) and its fixed destination. To improve the eavesdropping ability, cooperative legitimate UAVs emit jamming signals to reduce the capacities of suspicious channels and plan the flight trajectory to enhance the capacity of the eavesdropping channels. Considering the system dynamics, it is natural to model this sequential decision-making problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which might be solved by reinforcement learning (RL). However, it is difficult to design a policy in RL that determines jamming powers satisfying the considered eavesdropping constraints. Therefore, we decompose the optimization process into two phases, 1) obtaining the non-learning-based optimal solver for jamming power allocation under each state, and 2) optimizing the policy of moving action by RL. We will show this decoupled optimization process also holds the optimality. Considering the flying safety, we will determine the individual moving policy for each legitimate UAV rather than a centralized policy that controls all UAVs. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. © 2023 IEEE.","power allocation; Proactive eavesdropping; reinforcement learning (RL); trajectory planning; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Antennas; Behavioral research; Decision making; Drones; Jamming; Markov processes; Security systems; Trajectories; Aerial vehicle; Eavesdropping; Jamming; Optimisations; Power allocations; Proactive eavesdropping; Reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Surveillance; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Wireless communications; Reinforcement learning","L.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of trajectory planning and power control for the MU and RU collaboration. Firstly, considering the characteristics of multi-hop data transmission between the MU and Ground Control Station, a multi-UAV collaborative coverage model is designed. Meanwhile, a UAV control algorithm named MUTTO is proposed based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. In order to solve the problem of the unknown information about the number and locations of targets, the geographic coverage rate is used to replace the target coverage rate for decision making. Then, the reward functions of two types of UAVs are designed separately for the purpose of better cooperation. By simultaneously planning the trajectory and transmission power of the RU and MU, the mission target coverage rate and network transmission rate are maximized while the energy consumption of the UAV is minimized. Finally, numerical simulations results show that MUTTO can solve the UAV network control problem in an efficient way and has better performance than the benchmark method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Mission UAV; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-UAV collaboration; Relay UAV; Trajectory Planning and power control; UAV network","Aircraft control; Antennas; Benchmarking; Decision making; Energy utilization; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Numerical methods; Reinforcement learning; Rock mechanics; Trajectories; Aerial vehicle; Mission unmanned aerial vehicle; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle collaboration; Planning controls; Power-control; Relay unmanned aerial vehicle; Trajectory Planning; Trajectory planning and power control; Unmanned aerial vehicle network; Vehicle network; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","J.

This study presents a novel approach to optimizing collaborative navigation for UAVs using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). To enhance the efficiency of this process, we introduce the Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction (ADR) framework, which includes Autoencoders (AEs) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. The ADR framework significantly reduces computational complexity by simplifying high-dimensional state spaces while preserving crucial information. Additionally, we incorporate communication modules to facilitate inter-UAV coordination, further improving path planning efficiency.

Initially, FWL-PSO is constructed by harnessing the Fermat-Weber optimality to identify potential solutions. Within the framework of FWL-PSO, a collection of high-performing particles is established, determined by their respective fitness scores. Following this, the Fermat-Weber location of these elite particles is calculated to supersede the traditional global best, thereby augmenting the learning strategy of the standard PSO. As a result, this method enables the evolution of information while encouraging search diversity. Subsequently, FWL-PSO is employed for handling the interactions of multiple UAVs. In this context, the path planning for a group of UAVs is formulated as a Nash game that incorporates all cooperative interdependencies and safety conditions. The algorithm is then integrated to solve the optimization problem for achieving the Nash equilibrium. To assess its efficacy, extensive simulations and experiments are conducted across a variety of path-planning scenarios.

A multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaborative CCPP algorithm is proposed for the urban rescue search or military search in outdoor environment. Due to flexible control of small UAVs, it can be considered that all UAVs fly at the same altitude, that is, they perform search tasks on a two-dimensional plane. Based on the agents' motion characteristics and environmental information, a mathematical model of CCPP problem is established. The minimum time for UAVs to complete the CCPP is the objective function, and complete coverage constraint, no-fly constraint, collision avoidance constraint, and communication constraint are considered. Four motion strategies and two communication strategies are designed. Then a distributed CCPP algorithm is designed based on hybrid strategies.

However, as the number of UAVs increases, the scale of the path planning problem grows exponentially, leading to a significant rise in computational complexity. The Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithm (CCEA) effectively addresses this issue through its divide-and-conquer strategy. Nonetheless, the CCEA needs to find a balance between computational efficiency and algorithmic performance while also resolving convergence difficulties arising from the increased number of decision variables. Moreover, the complex interrelationships between the decision variables of each UAV add to the challenge of selecting appropriate decision variables. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel collaborative algorithm called CCEA-ADVS. This algorithm reduces the difficulty of the problem by decomposing high-dimensional variables into sub-variables for collaborative optimization. To improve the efficiency of decision variable selection in the collaborative algorithm and to accelerate the convergence speed, an adaptive decision variable selection strategy is introduced. This strategy selects decision variables according to the order of solving single-UAV constraints and multi-UAV constraints, reducing the cost of the optimization objective. Furthermore, to improve computational efficiency, a two-stage evolutionary optimization process from coarse to fine is adopted. Specifically, the Adaptive Differential Evolution with Optional External Archive algorithm (JADE) is first used to optimize the waypoints of the UAVs to generate a basic path, and then, the Dubins algorithm is combined to optimize the trajectory, yielding the final flight path. The experimental results show that in four different scenarios involving 40 UAVs, the CCEA-ADVS algorithm significantly outperforms the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and JADE algorithms in terms of path performance, running time, computational efficiency, and convergence speed. In addition, in large-scale experiments involving 500 UAVs, the algorithm also demonstrates good adaptability, stability, and scalability. © 2024 by the authors.","Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithm; decision variable; JADE algorithm; path planning; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Adaptive algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Health risks; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Co-evolutionary algorithm; Cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm; Decision variables; JADE algorithm; Path planning problems; Performance; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Variables selections; Vehicle path planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","T.

Multi-UAV systems have vast potential for applications in areas such as search and rescue. During search and rescue missions, UAVs acquire the location of the target to be rescued and subsequently plan a path that circumvents obstacles and leads to the target. Traditional path-planning algorithms require prior knowledge of obstacle distribution on the map, which may be difficult to obtain in real-world missions. To address the issue of traditional path-planning algorithms that rely on prior map information, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach for the collaborative exploration of multiple UAVs in unknown environments. First, a Markov decision process is employed to establish a game model and task objectives for the UAV cluster, considering the characteristics of collaborative exploration tasks and various constraints of UAV clusters. To maximize the search and rescue success rate, UAVs must satisfy dynamic and obstacle-avoidance constraints during mission execution. Second, a reinforcement learning-based method for the collaborative exploration of multiple UAVs is proposed. The multiagent soft actor–critic (MASAC) algorithm is used to iteratively train the UAVs’ collaborative exploration strategies. The actor network generates UAV actions, while the critic network evaluates the quality of these strategies. To enhance the algorithm’s generalization capability, training is conducted in randomly generated map environments. To avoid UAVs being obstructed by concave obstacles, a breadth-first search algorithm is used to calculate rewards based on the path distance between the UAVs and targets rather than the linear distance. During the exploration process, each UAV continuously collects and shares the map information with all other UAVs. They make individual action decisions based on the environment and information obtained from other UAVs, and the mission is considered successful if multiple UAVs hover above the target. Finally, a virtual simulation platform for algorithm validation is developed using the Unity game engine. The proposed algorithm is implemented using PyTorch, and bidirectional interaction between the Unity environment and Python algorithm is achieved through the ML-Agents (Machine learning agents) framework. Comparative experiments are conducted on the virtual simulation platform to compare the proposed algorithm with a non-cooperative single-agent SAC algorithm. The proposed method exhibits advantages in terms of task success rate, task completion efficiency, and episode rewards, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2024 Science Press.

Firstly, the maximum information delay is introduced to describe the timeliness of monitoring information. The constraints of UAV energy and no-fly zones are all taken in account and a multi-UAV path planning model with UAV information delay and total fight distance as optimization objectives is established. Subsequently, an improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer is proposed, which incorporates a crossover operator to enhance global search ability and a large-scale neighborhood algorithm to improve local search ability. Finally, the probabilistic roadmap algorithm is used to perform local obstacle avoidance optimization on the obtained flight plan in order to obtain optimal planned path. The simulation and physical experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves favorable planned path but also, compared to the NSGA-II, reduces the total flight path distance by 3.34% and 5.09% respectively, and decreases the maximum delay time by 11.02% and 15.66%.

In this study, a cooperative coevolution motion-encoded particle swarm optimization algorithm called the CC-MPSO search algorithm is designed to tackle the moving target search issue effectively. Firstly, a Markov process-based target motion model considering the uncertainty of target motion is investigated. Secondly, Bayesian theory is used to formulate the moving target search as an optimization problem where the objective function is defined as maximizing the cumulative probability of detection of the target in finite time. Finally, the problem is solved based on the CC-MPSO algorithm to obtain the optimal search path nodes. The motion encoding mechanism converts the search path nodes into a set of motion paths, which enables more flexible handling of UAV trajectories and improves the efficiency of dynamic path planning. Meanwhile, the cooperative coevolution optimization framework enables collaboration between different UAVs to improve global search performance through multiple swarm information sharing, which helps avoid falling into local optimal solutions. The simulation results show that the CC-MPSO algorithm demonstrates efficacy, reliability, and superior overall performance when compared to the five commonly used swarm intelligence algorithms. © 2024 by the authors.","cooperative coevolutionary approach; moving target search; multi-UAV planning; particle swarm optimization","","B.

A data requestor may first deploy a set of IoT devices into the monitoring regions like the disaster area or the battlefield, and deliver a group of UAVs to collaboratively collect data from these IoT devices. Constrained by the battery power and limited capabilities of UAVs, the data requestor must design flying routes for grouped UAVs such that the collected data volumes, the return and the flight safety of UAVs are properly balanced. In recent years, deep Q-network (DQN) models have been extensively applied for multi-UAV path planning owing to its superiority in representing the surrounding environment and action space for UAVs. However, previous solutions majorly focus on applying advanced DQNs for UAV path planning in different system settings, while the specific designs for non-cooperative and adversarial environment is seldom mentioned. This fact has reduced the performance for multi-UAV data collection in adversarial environment, like the rescue in disaster area and the investigation in conflicting regions. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel DQN framework addressing the critical issues in adversarial environments. First, we assume and formulate the existence of trapping and eavesdropping attacks in monitoring regions, which are conducted by rivals to directly hijack the UAVs or overhear the transmitted information among IoT devices and UAVs. Second, a novel Deep Q-learning model is designed which encodes the surrounding threats into the state space and Q-networks, by combining them with the battery capacity, the safe flying distance among UAVs and the volume of collected data. Besides, a novel reward function is also designed to further refine the action series of UAVs for better data coverage among devices and safety landing. Third, we design a Shamir threshold method based mechanism for secure information sharing between IoT devices and UAVs, such that the original data can be properly concealed under eavesdropping attacks. Finally, extensive simulation results have demonstrated the advanced performance for multi-UAV data collection in adversarial environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Antennas; Data acquisition; Deep learning; Disasters; Internet of things; Motion planning; Secondary batteries; Security systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Adversarial environments; Aerial vehicle; Data collection; Data harvesting; Disaster areas; Eavesdropping attacks; Performance; Reinforcement learnings; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle path planning; Reinforcement learning","K.M.R.

However, due to the distance limitations of the remote control and endurance of a UAV, a single UAV cannot effectively perform a search mission in various and complex regions. Thus, using a group of UAVs to deal with coverage search missions has become a research hotspot in the last decade. In this paper, a differential evolution (DE)-based multi-UAV cooperative coverage algorithm is proposed to deal with the coverage tasks in different regions. In the proposed algorithm, named DECSMU, the entire coverage process is divided into many coverage stages. Before each coverage stage, every UAV automatically plans its flight path based on DE. To obtain a promising flight trajectory for a UAV, a dynamic reward function is designed to evaluate the quality of the planned path in terms of the coverage rate and the energy consumption of the UAV. In each coverage stage, an information interaction between different UAVs is carried out through a communication network, and a distributed model predictive control is used to realize the collaborative coverage of multiple UAVs. The experimental results show that the strategy can achieve high coverage and a low energy consumption index under the constraints of collision avoidance. The favorable performance in DECSMU on different regions also demonstrate that it has outstanding stability and generality. © 2024 by the authors.","coverage path planning; differential evolution; dynamic reward function; multi-UAV","","X.

Heterogeneous UAVs outperform homogeneous UAVs in terms of energy consumption and performance. The use of several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) inside broad cooperative search systems, including numerous separate locations, provides the difficulty of sophisticated path planning. The computational complexity of NP-hard problems makes coverage path planning a difficult challenge to solve. This difficulty stems from the need to establish the most effective paths for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to thoroughly explore selected areas of interest. In this paper, Improved Green Anaconda Optimization Algorithm-based Coverage Path Planning Mechanism is proposed for handling the problem of coverage path planning in UAVs. It specifically adopted an improved Green Anaconda Optimization System (IGAOS) to determines possible and potential paths for the UAVs to fully cover the complete regions of interest in an efficient manner. Initially, the regions and models of UAVs are established using linear programming for identifying the best-to-point flight path for each UAV. It is proposed for minimizing the tasks’ time consumption in the system of cooperative search through the exploration of optimal solution depending on the inspiration derived from the hunting and mating strategy of green anacondas.

UAV make decisions based on battlefield situation information collected by sensors and can quickly and accurately perform complex tasks such as path planning, cooperative reconnaissance, cooperative pursuit and attacks. Obtaining real-time situation information of enemy is the basis for realizing autonomous decision-making of the UAV. However, in practice, due to internal sensor failure or interference of enemy, the acquired situation information is prone to be missing, which affects the training and decision-making of autonomous UAV. In this paper, an adaptive missing situation data restoration method for UAV confrontation is proposed. The UAV confrontation situation data are acquired through JSBSim, an open-source UAV simulation platform. By fusing temporal convolutional network and long short-term memory sequences, we establish a deep regression method for missing data restoration and introduce an adaptive mechanism to reduce the training time of the restoration model in response to dynamic changes in the enemy’s strategy during UAV confrontation. In addition, we evaluate the reliability of the proposed method by comparing with different baseline models under different degrees of data missing conditions. The performance of our method is quantified by five metrics. The performance of our proposed method is better than the other benchmark algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the missing data restoration problem and provide reliable situation data while effectively reducing the training time of the restoration model. © The Author(s) 2024.","Data restoration; Deep regression model; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Temporal convolutional network (TCN); UAV","Associative storage; Benchmarking; Network security; Restoration; Aerial vehicle; Convolutional networks; Data restoration; Deep regression model; Long short-term memory; Missing data; Regression modelling; Short term memory; Temporal convolutional network; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","X.

By cooperating with each other to complete continuous monitoring tasks, the work efficiency can be improved and the problem of insufficient endurance capacity of the UAV can be solved. In this heterogeneous robot system, the UGV can recharge energy for the UAV to ensure the continuity of the monitoring task. Since periodic monitoring paths are prone to leakage of monitoring regularity information, it is significant to improve the randomness of the UAV's monitoring path. Aiming at this problem, this paper introduces the Gini impurity index to evaluate the randomness of the monitoring path. With the optimization goal of minimizing the weighted sum of normalized visit interval time of target nodes and their Gini impurity, a continuous monitoring path planning model of the UAV & UGV cooperative system is established,which improves the privacy of monitoring path. Finally, the ant colony algorithm is used to optimize the UAV's monitoring path and the UGV's energy supply path, which verifies the validity and rationality of the model. Compared with other algorithms, it is proved that the ant colony algorithm has faster search speed and operation efficiency. © 2024 Northeast University.

However, most prior research neglects the impact of ECs' battery constraint on the system performance, especially in disaster scenarios. In this study, we introduce a novel time-slot-based UES-assisted system that aims to conserve energy and extend the overall lifetime of EC networks. Our proposed system operates in discrete time slots, wherein the UES alternates between hovering and serving ECs, or flying to a new position within its coverage area to provide better assistance. To minimize the computational overhead of ECs during hovering and serving within a time slot, we present a new task offloading scheme based on the differential evolutionary algorithm. For optimizing the UES's flying trajectory, we formulate the UES movement as a Markov decision process, taking into account system state changes. Subsequently, we design an efficient UES trajectory planning algorithm using double deep Q-learning. This algorithm optimizes energy consumption, feedback reward, and the overall system overhead, resulting in a doubling of the system's lifetime. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed task offloading algorithm exhibits high accuracy and fast convergence compared to four other state-of-the-art strategies. Moreover, the UES trajectory planning algorithm doubles the system's lifetime while reducing energy consumption and total system overhead.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","double deep q-learning; Edge computing; task scheduling; trajectory planning; unmanned aerial vehicles","Antennas; Computation offloading; Deep learning; Disasters; Drones; Energy utilization; Graphics processing unit; Job analysis; Markov processes; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Aerial vehicle; Battery; Double deep Q-learning; Edge computing; Energy-consumption; Q-learning; Resource management; Task analysis; Tasks scheduling; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Trajectories","K.

This paper introduces a method that leverages accumulated target-density information over the course of a UAV mission to adapt path-planning rewards, guiding UAVs toward areas with a higher likelihood of target presence. The target density is modeled using a Gaussian process, which is iteratively updated as the UAVs search the environment. Unlike conventional search algorithms that prioritize unexplored regions, this approach incentivizes revisiting target-rich areas. The target-density information is shared across UAVs using decentralized consensus filters, enabling cooperative path selection that balances the exploration of uncertain regions with the exploitation of known high-density areas. The framework presented in this paper provides an adaptive cooperative search method that can quickly develop an understanding of the region’s target-dense areas, helping UAVs refine their search. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate this method in both a 2D grid region and road networks, showing up to a 26% improvement in target density estimates. © 2024 by the authors.","Gaussian process regression; mission planning; search and tracking; unmanned aerial vehicles","Aircraft detection; Motion planning; Motor transportation; Regression analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Decentralised; Gaussian process regression; Mission planning; Moving targets; Multi agent; Road network; Search and tracking; Target density; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Gaussian distribution","B.

The cooperative obstacle avoidance and trajectory planning issues that UAVs come up with when navigating through environments full of obstacles are discussed in this paper. A set of modeling schemes for optimal path planning based on benchmarks, i.e. the shortest path, shortest flying time, and least energy consumption is generated. While integrating the traditional static global planning A* algorithm with sparse optimization and improve the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), an A*-Bi-objective DWA (A*-BDWA) algorithm was proposed, which generates global paths using the sparsified A* algorithm, then performs optimization on local paths for UAVs with various attributes and complex environments by summing scores of weighting headings, obstacle distance, and sightline as an evaluation function. The propose scheme offers optimal path trajectory simulations and time measurements for two UAVs, resulting in better models for possibly extreme cases. Simulations indicate that the proposed scheme ensures safe, collision-free pathways and dynamic obstacle avoidance during dual UAV operations. Besides, changing weights of score has little effect on UAV flying time, demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of our approach. With various repetitive and difficult simulation conditions upon testing, the proposed scheme displays a high completion rate of 88.3% and the shortest flight time, proving stability and efficiency for significant practical implications. © (2024), (International Association of Engineers).

However, the performance of the PSO algorithm is highly sensitive to its control parameters and learning strategies. To address this problem, a multi-subswarm cooperative particle swarm optimization algorithm (MSC-PSO) is proposed in this paper. In MSC-PSO, firstly, a population muti-subswarm division method is designed to enhance the global exploration capability. Secondly, a level-based particle adaptive inertia weight strategy is introduced to adjust control parameters. Finally, a level-based update learning mechanism is used for particles adaptive selection learning strategy. The performance of the MSC-PSO is evaluated by the CEC2020 test suite, and five heuristic algorithms are compared with the MSC-PSO in the experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSC-PSO algorithm has significant advantages in terms of convergence speed and solving optimal solutions. Furthermore, the proposed MSC-PSO algorithm is used to solve the plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) path planning problem.

Coordinating multiple UAVs enables more rapid and efficient task execution compared to a single UAV. The proliferation of UAVs across various sectors, including entertainment, transportation, delivery, and social domains, as well as military applications such as surveillance, tracking, and attack, has spurred research in swarm systems. In this study, a new swarm topology is presented by combining the Consensus-Based Virtual Leader Tracking Swarm Algorithm (CBVLTSA), which provides formation control in swarm systems, with the Goal Distance-based Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree with Particle Swarm Optimization (GDRRT*-PSO) route planning algorithm. Recently proposed, GDRRT* is notable for its efficient operation in expansive environments and rapid convergence to the goal. Within this framework, the path generated by GDRRT* is optimized using PSO to yield the shortest current route. CBVLTSA employs a potential push and pull function to facilitate cooperative, coordinated flight among swarm members. While applying pushing force to avoid collisions with each other and obstacles, members also exert pulling force to maintain flight formation while navigating to target points. This ensures controlled flight formation and collision-free traversal along the GDRRT*-PSO route. Consequently, unlike the others, the proposed algorithm achieves faster target reach with pre-planned routes, demonstrating a robust and flexible swarm topology with CBVLTSA. Moreover, we anticipate the significant utility of this algorithm across various swarm applications, including target detection, observation, tracking, trade and transportation logistics, and collective defense and attack strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Collision avoidance; Formation Control; Path-planning; Target detection","Aircraft detection; Collision avoidance; Military applications; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Trees (mathematics); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Collisions avoidance; Distance-based; Formation control; Multiple UAVs; Particle swarm; Rapidly-exploring random trees; Swarm algorithms; Swarm optimization; Targets detection; Virtual leader; Motion planning","B.

However, in real-world applications, the distance between UAVs often exceeds the communication range, leading to communication disruptions and challenges in UAV collaboration and information exchange. Therefore, a multi-UAV coverage path planning (CPP) method based on Deep Q Networks (DQN) is proposed. The path quality is evaluated by two indexes, communication disruption rate and maximum communication disruption time, and the autonomous path decision-making for UAV teams is realized by constructing reward functions related to these indexes. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be consistent with the traditional optimization algorithms on the shortest path. Moreover, under a balanced path condition, the communication interruption rate can be reduced by 80% with a 20% increase in path length. Additionally, under full communication path conditions, the communication with connected network throughout the entire process can be achieved by 100%.

However, there is still a lack of research in the areas of multi-target detection task assignment and swarm path planning, both of which play a vital role in enhancing the efficiency of environment exploration and reducing energy consumption. In this paper, we propose an air–ground collaborative multi-target detection task model based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). In order to make the model more suitable for real situations, kinematic constraints of the UAVs and UGVs, dynamic collision avoidance constraints, task allocation constraints, and obstacle avoidance constraints are added to the model. We also establish an objective function that comprehensively considers time consumption, energy consumption, and trajectory smoothness to improve the authenticity of the model and achieve a more realistic purpose. Meanwhile, a Branch-and-Bound method combined with the Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA-B&B) is proposed to solve the objective function, and the optimal task assignment and optimal path of air–ground collaborative multi-target detection can be obtained. A simulation environment with multi-agents, multi-obstacles, and multi-task points is established. The simulation results show that the proposed IGA-B&B algorithm can reduce the computation time cost by 30% compared to the traditional Branch-and-Bound (B&B) method. In addition, an experiment is carried out in an outdoor environment, which further validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. © 2024 by the authors.","air–ground collaborative system; MILP; swarm path planning; task assignment","Aircraft accidents; Aircraft detection; Integer linear programming; Integer programming; Linear programming; Mixed-integer linear programming; Motion planning; Optimal detection; Swarm intelligence; Aerial vehicle; Air grounds; Air–ground collaborative system; Collaborative systems; Detection tasks; Integer Linear Programming; Mixed integer linear; Multi-target detection; Swarm path planning; Tasks assignments; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","K.

Caching at edge UAVs is an effective emerging solution for relieving the wireless backhaul congestion and reducing content fetching latency for hotspot areas. This article investigates a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled multi-UAV collaborative caching network, where the multimedia contents are delivered from UAVs to ground users. UAVs cache popular contents and collaboratively share with each other. The optimization problem of joint caching decision, 3D trajectory planning and spectrum resource allocation is formulated for minimizing the system content retrieving delay. It is an NP-hard mixed integer nonconvex optimization issue with extra difficulty that the content popularity is highly dynamic. To tackle this challenging problem, we decouple the original issue into two subproblems: (1) UAV collaborative caching decision making and (2) joint optimization of UAV trajectory planning, power allocation, and channel reusing. We develop a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm for the former to achieve the maximum weighted content hit ratio and propose a matching-DRL solution for the latter.

The market penetration rate(MPR)of CAVs is expected to increase substantially in the near future. Furthermore,CAV deployment scenarios,such as mixed traffic (including conventional vehicles and CAVs)on urban road networks,will become increasingly complex. Therefore,the technological demand for advanced CAV modules(e. g.,sensing,perception,awareness,and motion planning)will notably increase to ensure efficiency and safety. Infrastructure-aided solutions using roadside units(RSUs)are often used to meet increasing technological demand in a complex traffic scenario. RSUs can help promote CAV deployment by providing vehicles with scalable communication,sensor,and computational support. As a general rule,V2X connectivity and CAV performance improve as the number of RSUs increases. However,the majority of existing RSUs are built in fixed locations, resulting in important concerns such as restricted deployment coverage and utilization efficiency. Furthermore,updating its capabilities(for example,developing next-generation communication technologies)is exceedingly challenging. Therefore, the necessity for flexible and intelligent resource allocation in the Transportation 5. 0 era cannot be met. As an emerging technology,drones offer a viable answer to the aforementioned difficulties. To fill the technological gaps in deploying CAVs,a framework integrating drones with the existing infrastructure-aided system to assist in CAV deployment is proposed,and a dynamic on-demand operation algorithm for drones under the framework considering sensing and communication tasks is introduced. Method The on-demand operation approach,which involves deploying drones to perform sensing and communication tasks,is introduced to verify the feasibility of the proposed framework. The operation of drones is based on a bi-level approach,where the upper level corresponds to task planning in a discrete-time dimension and the lower level corresponds to motion planning with a finer time granularity. In this approach,the upper level sets performance constraints for the lower level during task planning,while the upper level assesses the feasibility of these constraints and performs corresponding motion planning. A continuous feedback loop exists between the levels in the hierarchical structure of drone operations to ensure coordination between the upper and lower levels. The details of the deployment method at the upper level,which aims to deploy drones in an efficient and cost-effective manner,are described. Additionally,the motion planning of the drones at the lower level based on the virtual force field model is introduced in response to dynamic sensing and communication demand. The lower level of the operation approach models the demands for optimal coverage as a virtual force field. The force field includes two kinds of virtual forces:the attractive force toward CAVs is introduced to facilitate the precise deployment of drones to cover the sensing and communication demands of CAVs. Meanwhile,the repulsive forces push away two drones between which the distance is closer than the desired value. Each drone then follows this force field to move toward its proper position. Result Experiments and analyses are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework in a simulated traffic network with fixed RSU and dynamic CAV distributions with different MPRs. A series of experiments,which set the time step of the update frequency to 10 min,is also conducted to validate the deployment efficacy of the bi-level deployment algorithm. Utilizing experiment settings as the basis,the distribution of CAV on road segments in the network is generated with different MPRs. The sensing and communication demands of CAVs in accordance with the penetration rate are estimated. The interaction probability between CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs)is estimated using numerical simulations and Monte Carlo-based statistical analysis. The number of interactions between CAVs and HDVs in this network initially rises and reaches its peak at 50% as the penetration rate of CAVs increases. When the penetration rate exceeds 20%,a single RSU with peak data rates of 650 Mbps is no longer sufficient to meet the communication demand on the road segment during peak hours. The results indicate that employing drones instead of RSUs to support autonomous driving perception and communication enables the accomplishment of additional perception and communication tasks within limited quantities and time constraints due to the dynamic distribution of CAV demands,which demonstrate substantial fluctuation within a day. The results of the deployment algorithm indicate that if a traditional vehicle-infrastructure(VI)solution is employed by installing RSUs for each target location on the demand list, then an idle rate of more than 60% is obtained for the RSUs. Specifically,the idle rates of RSUs in the VI framework are calculated with an MPR of 10%,50%,and 90%,and the temporal variation of the idle rates in the target area is compared. Integrating drones into the current VI framework and adopting an on-demand operation approach show potential for reducing idle rates. Conclusion Overall,this paper proposes a novel framework to boost CAV deployment in mixed traffic scenarios by adopting drones in the existing infrastructure-aided system. The proposed framework shows its potential to boost CAV deployment in a flexible,intelligent,and cost-efficient manner. The simulation experiments indicate that the framework facilitates improved communication coverage and alleviates congestion issues. ©中国图象图形学报版权所有","autonomous driving; bi-level scheduling algorithm; cross-domain collaboration; on-demand scheduling of drones; trajectory planning based on virtual force field","","L.

However, when there are numerous obstacles in the environment, especially narrow passageways, the algorithm often struggles to quickly find a viable path. Additionally, collaborative constraints among multiple UAVs complicate the search space, making algorithm convergence challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm called PPSwarm. This approach initially employs the RRT* algorithm to generate an initial path, rapidly identifying a feasible solution in complex environments. Subsequently, we adopt a priority planning method to assign priorities to UAVs, simplifying collaboration among them. Furthermore, by introducing a path randomization strategy, we enhance the diversity of the particle swarm, thereby avoiding local optimum solutions. The experimental results show that, in comparison to algorithms such as DE, PSO, ABC, GWO, and SPSO, the PPSwarm algorithm demonstrates significant advantages in terms of path quality, convergence speed, and runtime when addressing path planning issues for 40 UAVs across four different scenarios. In larger-scale experiments involving 500 UAVs, the proposed algorithm also exhibits excellent processing capability and scalability. © 2024 by the authors.","particle swarm optimization; path planning; prioritized planning methods; RRT*; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Interpolation; Motion planning; Optimization algorithms; Swarm intelligence; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Hybrid PSO; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Planning method; Prioritized planning method; RRT*; Swarm optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle path planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Q.

Enhancing the coordination performance of multi-UAV systems can be achieved through task allocation methods, typically relying on a hierarchical structure. This paper proposes a novel approach using a modified genetic algorithm (GA) to address the integrated task allocation and path planning problems for multi-UAV attacking multi-target. To create a more realistic mission scenario, multiple constraints, such as resource requirement and simultaneous target arrival, are considered. The modified GA incorporates tailored crossover and mutation operators that ensure compliance with the aforementioned constraints. Furthermore, an unlocking strategy is devised to prevent the occurrence of a chromosome deadlock condition, in which several UAVs become stuck in an infinite waiting state. Through simulation results, the modified GA is demonstrated to effectively delivers feasible solutions to the coupled task allocation and path planning problems, preserving the integrated nature of the optimization process.

To be close to the practical scenario, this paper proposes a path planning method based on an action-mask-based multi-agent proximal policy optimization (AM-MAPPO) algorithm for multiple UAVs searching for moving targets in three-dimensional (3D) environments. In particular, a multi-UAV high–low altitude collaborative search architecture is introduced that not only takes into account the extensive detection range of high-altitude UAVs but also leverages the benefit of the superior detection quality of low-altitude UAVs. The optimization objective of the search task is to minimize the uncertainty of the search area while maximizing the number of captured moving targets. The path planning problem for moving target search in a 3D environment is formulated and addressed using the AM-MAPPO algorithm. The proposed method incorporates a state representation mechanism based on field-of-view encoding to handle dynamic changes in neural network input dimensions and develops a rule-based target capture mechanism and an action-mask-based collision avoidance mechanism to enhance the AM-MAPPO algorithm’s convergence speed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces regional uncertainty and increases the number of captured moving targets compared to other deep reinforcement learning methods. Ablation studies further indicate that the proposed action mask mechanism, target capture mechanism, and collision avoidance mechanism of the AM-MAPPO algorithm can improve the algorithm’s effectiveness, target capture capability, and UAVs’ safety, respectively. © 2024 by the authors.","cooperative target search; multi-UAV; path planning; reinforcement learning","Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cooperative target search; Cooperative targets; Moving targets; Multi agent; Multi UAV; Optimization algorithms; Policy optimization; Reinforcement learnings; Target capture; Target search; Deep reinforcement learning","X.

However, QUATRE shares some of the same weaknesses as DE, such as premature convergence and search stagnation. Inspired by the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), we propose a new QUATRE algorithm to improve these problems that ranks all the individuals and evolves only the poorer half of the population. In an evolving population, individuals of different levels intersect with dimensions of different sizes to improve search efficiency and accuracy. In addition, we establish a better selection framework for the parent generation individuals and select more excellent parent individuals to complete the evolution for the individuals trapped in search stagnation. To verify the performance of the new QUATRE algorithm, we divide the comparison algorithm into three groups, including ABC variant group, DE variant group, and QUATRE variant group, and the CEC2014 test suite is used for the comparison. The experimental results show the new QUATRE algorithm performance is competitive. We also successfully apply the new QUATRE algorithm on the 3D path planning of UAV, and compared with the other famous algorithm performance it is still outstanding, which verifies the algorithm's practicability.  © 2024 - IOS Press.

Traditional optimization methods often struggle to address the multidimensional nature of these problems, particularly when considering constraints like obstacle avoidance, energy efficiency, and real-time responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Dimensional Learning Strategy and Spherical Motion-based Particle Swarm Optimization (DLS-SMPSO), specifically designed to handle the unique constraints and requirements of cooperative path planning for Multiple UAVs (Multi-UAVs). By encoding particle positions as motion paths in spherical coordinates, the algorithm offers a natural and effective approach to navigating multidimensional search spaces. The incorporation of a Dimensional Learning Strategy (DLS) enhances performance by minimizing particle oscillations and allowing each particle to learn valuable information from the global best solution on a dimension-by-dimension basis. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the DLS-SMPSO algorithm, demonstrating its capability to consistently generate optimal paths. The proposed algorithm outperforms other metaheuristic optimization algorithms, achieving a feasibility ratio as high as 97%. The proposed solution is scalable, adaptable, and suitable for real-time implementation, making it an excellent choice for a broad range of cooperative multi-UAV applications. © 2024 by the authors.","cooperative path planning; DLS-SMPSO; energy consumption constraint; multi-UAVs; time-varying communication constraint","Aircraft communication; Health risks; Motion planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Communication constraints; Cooperative path planning; Dimensional learning strategy and spherical motion-based particle swarm optimization; Energy consumption constraints; Learning strategy; Multi UAV; Particle swarm; Spherical motion; Swarm optimization; Time varying; Time-varying communication constraint; Energy efficiency","J.

Inspired by this, a servo control system for mobile robots based on UAV global vision is designed in this paper. Firstly, acquire global visual images and process them, selecting target points via mouse under global vision. Secondly, plan an obstacle avoidance path to reach the target point using artificial potential field method, and smooth the path using B-spline curves. Then, establish the kinematic model of the mobile robot and use the LQR algorithm to enable the robot to track the path. Finally, experimental tests were conducted via the Webots simulation platform to verify the feasibility of the system.

In this paper, a cooperative multi-task allocation model is proposed for heterogeneous UAVs based on area segmentation to approximate real-world mapping applications. Specifically, it considers area mapping task requirements, UAV kinematics constraints, resource constraints (maximum endurance and sensor capabilities), and task number ceiling constraints; and optimises the task sequence based on the objective function that considers UAVs coverage path planning characteristics. However, a general genetic algorithm (GA) could undermine the feasibility of the solution in the population, resulting in an undesirable optimisation effect when performing genetic operations on a large-scale task allocation problem with strong coupling constraints and an obscure encoding relation. An improved double-chromosome encoding GA with a conflict-mediation mechanism is proposed to perform genetic operations on the population while meeting these constraints. The proposed GA ensures the universal excellence of population evolution while significantly improving the population optimisation and convergence performance. The simulation results show that the proposed GA has greater global search ability, stability, and speed compared with existing algorithms. © 2024","Constrained optimisation; Cooperative mapping; Genetic algorithm; Heterogeneous system; Task assignment","Antennas; Chromosomes; Constrained optimization; Encoding (symbols); Mapping; Motion planning; Signal encoding; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Airborne cameras; Allocation model; Cooperative mapping; Genetic operations; Geographic information; Ground stations; Heterogeneous systems; Multi-task allocation; Tasks assignments; Genetic algorithms","X.

To improve the service quality, this paper formulates a unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) framework for time-varying heterogeneous task requirements.

To address the considered trajectory planning optimization problem, a collaborative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm is proposed, where each UAV is regarded as a learning agent. First, a counterfactual inference based personalized policy update mechanism is proposed to evaluate the independent policy of agents by comparing the policy with a designed counterfactual policy. Based on this idea, each agent updates a personalized policy from both group and individual interests to improve its cooperation ability in dynamic and complex environments. Then, a diversified experience sampling mechanism is proposed to enhance the efficiency of policy evaluation and update with rich experiences provided by the environment interaction and the modified whale optimization algorithm.

However, due to the intrinsically limited resources that UAVs can utilize, it is challenging to achieve performance improvement for dual purposes. Toward this end, in this paper, an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) UAV-enabled ISAC system is investigated, and a joint trajectory planning and resource allocation problem is formulated to minimize the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for target location estimation while guaranteeing the communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints.

To ensure the success rate of penetration and strike missions, this paper establishes a multi-UAV cooperative route planning model guided by mission requirements, considering low-altitude obstacles and enemy detection threats. First, we establish an interaction model between UAVs, terrain, and enemy threats to clarify the feasibility of low-altitude penetration missions. Based on this, we introduce an ant colony algorithm enhanced with a fuzzy logic memory mechanism (FLM-IACO) to obtain lower-cost flight routes. Then we implement a pheromone initialization approach factoring in altitude, prioritizing the development of feasible flight routes within radar detection blind spots to enhance stealth capabilities. Moreover, a mixed pheromone structure delineates infeasible regions identified during the path-planning process. Subsequent nodes’ reliability is assessed using membership degrees. In the final stage, a layered extension and correction strategy is employed to refine the flight paths. Simulations under different terrain data evaluate our method across various mission requirements. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves shorter, safer, and more energy-efficient flight paths within the same number of iterations, underscoring its significant practical value. © 2024 The Franklin Institute","Ant colony optimization; Multiple UAV; Radar threat; Route planning","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Energy efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Motion planning; Tracking radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Flight route; Improved ant colony algorithm; Military fields; Mission requirements; Multiple UAVs; Radar threat; Rate of penetration; Route planning; Strike mission; Ant colony optimization","Q.

Despite these advantages, existing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning algorithms are often hindered by slow convergence rates, susceptibility to local optima, and limited robustness. To surpass these limitations, we enhance the application of GWO in UAV path planning by improving its trajectory evaluation function, convergence factor, and position update method. We propose a collaborative UAV path planning model that includes constraint analysis and an evaluation function. Subsequently, an Enhanced Grey Wolf Optimizer model (NI–GWO) is introduced, which optimizes the convergence coefficient using a nonlinear function and integrates the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithm into the model based on the fitness of individual wolves, enabling it to perform dynamic obstacle avoidance tasks. In the final stage, a UAV path planning simulation platform is employed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the original and improved algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NI–GWO algorithm can effectively solve the path planning problem for UAVs in uncertain environments.

Nevertheless, the jamming resistance appears to be a new challenge in multi-UAV cooperative communication scenarios. This paper focuses on designing trajectory planning and power allocation for efficient control and reliable communication in a ground control unit (GCU)-controlled UAV network, where the GCU coordinates multi-UAV systems to execute tasks amidst multiple jammers with imperfect location and power information. Specifically, this paper formulates a nonconvex semi-infinite optimization problem to maximize the average worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among multiple UAVs by designing robust flight paths and power control strategy under stringent energy and mobility constraints. To efficiently address this issue, this paper proposes a powerful iterative algorithm utilizing the S-procedure and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2024 by the authors.","multi-UAV; nonconvex optimization; power allocation; trajectory planning","Aircraft communication; Antenna grounds; Convex optimization; Flight simulators; Robust control; Robustness (control systems); Aerial vehicle; Control unit; Ground control; Jammers; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle; Nonconvex optimization; Nonconvex-optimization; Power allocations; Reliable communication; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Z.

In this field, multi-UAV cooperative dynamic target path planning is very important to achieve efficient task completion. However, the existing algorithms have some limitations in solving the problems of insufficient search range, premature convergence, local optimization and insufficient population diversity. In order to solve these problems and improve the efficiency and accuracy of path planning, this paper proposes an innovative method. Firstly, we use A* algorithm to obtain the initial assignment result of UAV target, and then use Hungarian algorithm and genetic algorithm to optimize the assignment result and expand the target assignment range. Secondly, in the path planning stage, the bat algorithm is improved, and sine function, dynamic expansion factor and nonlinear function are introduced to solve the problems of insufficient search range, premature convergence and local optimization. At the same time, genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem of insufficient population. By optimizing target assignment and path planning, the performance of multi-UAV cooperative system is improved, so as to better adapt to the task requirements in dynamic environment and provide more reliable solutions for UAV applications. The experimental results show that the tracking and path planning are more effective than BA, CCWOA and OUMPOA under the condition of good stability. Compared with BA, the fitness function and convergence speed are improved by 34.64% and 30.29% respectively. © 2024","Bat algorithm; Dynamic function; Dynamic interference coefficient; Genetic algorithm; Hungarian algorithm; Multi-UAV","Aircraft detection; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Bat algorithms; Cooperative dynamics; Dynamic functions; Dynamic interference coefficient; Dynamic target; Hungarian algorithm; Local optimizations; Multi UAV; Premature convergence; Search range; Genetic algorithms","X.

Collaborative payload transportation utilizing multiple UAVs can effectively increase the payload capacity of the transportation system. Nevertheless, the incorporation of multiple UAVs makes the dynamic model of the transportation system more complex due to the coupled UAV and payload states. In the immediate disaster relief response, the collaborative system is often required to promptly deliver supplies to the target site while avoiding obstacles to ensure the system’s safety. Consequently, devising fast delivery trajectories that avoid collisions for such complicated systems poses a considerable challenge. To this end, a novel trajectory planning method is presented for collaborative transportation systems. Specifically, the dynamic model of the collaborative transportation system is derived by utilizing the Euler–Lagrange method. Then, the trajectory planning problem is formulated as an optimization problem with considerations of dynamics, actuation, safety, and formation constraints. To expedite the optimization process, the collision avoidance safety constraint is constructed using dual variables. The efficacy of this trajectory planning approach is confirmed through multiple real-world flight experiments involving collaborative aerial transportation systems of two and three UAVs. © 2024 by the authors.","cable-suspended; collaborative aerial transportation; collision avoidance; trajectory planning","Air transportation; Aircraft accidents; Aerial transportation; Cable-suspended; Collaborative aerial transportation; Collisions avoidance; Dynamics models; Multiple UAVs; Safety constraint; Trajectory Planning; Transportation system; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","X.

Aiming at the real-time changes of the ships position during the detection process, the “meeting” model was adopted to solve the encounter position of ships and UAV, and a UAV path optimization model targeting the minimum flight distance of moving ships was established to achieve collaborative detection of multiple UAVs accordingly. The two-stage algorithm by combining sequence insertion algorithm and a genetic algorithm based on two ship sequence decomposition strategies, DroneByDrone and ShipByShip were designed to achieve UAV path optimization in scenarios of different scales. Numerical experiments show that a path optimization method that taking into account of both UAV flight and ship navigation can effectively improve the detection efficiency of moving ships. Both algorithms can successfully solve the model, but compared to the two-stage algorithm, the genetic algorithm can shorten the solving time by 65.12%, meeting the requirements of solving timeliness. The flight distance of UAVs is significantly sensitive to the number of UAVs, in the same dataset, dispatching two UAVs can optimize the flight distance by 25% compared to three UAVs, but the detection time will be correspondingly delayed by 8%. By comprehensively optimizing the position of UAV base stations, the number and speed of UAVs based on experimental scenarios, the flight distance of UAVs can be effectively shortened, and the detection efficiency can be improved. © 2024 Editorial Office of Journal of Dalian Maritime University.

Currently, algae monitoring is carried out manually by collecting samples to send for laboratory analysis. In most cases, harmful algal blooms are already widespread when the results are disclosed. This paper proposes the application of a team of heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that cooperate to increase the system’s overall observation range and reduce the reaction time. Leader UAV, featured with a deep-learning-based vision system, covers a pre-determined region and determines high-interest inspection areas in real-time. Through a multi-robot Informative Path Planning (MIPP) approach, the leader UAV coordinates a team of customized quadcopter (named ART2) to reach points of interest, managing their route dynamically. ART2s are able to land on water, and collect and test samples in situ by applying phosphorescence sensors. While path planning, task assignment, and route management are centralized operations, each UAV is conducted by a decentralized trajectory tracking control. Simulations performed in a realistic environment implemented on the Unity platform and experimental proof of concepts demonstrated the reliability of the proposed approach. The presented multi-UAV framework with heterogeneous agents also enables the reconfiguration and expansion of specific objectives, in addition to minimizing the task completion time by executing different processes in parallel. This preventive monitoring enables a plague control action in advance, solving it faster, cheaper, and more effectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Aquatic macrophytes; Collaboration; Cyanobacterial blooms; Multi-UAV","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Deep learning; Motion planning; Robot programming; Simulation platform; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Aquatic macrophyte; Aquatic macrophytes; Collaboration; Collaborative systems; Cyanobacterial blooms; Fresh Water; Macro algae; Macro-algae; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle; Algae","K.

EDSCSO aims to solve the problems of the original SCSO, such as the limited diversity of the population, low efficiency of solving complex functions, and ease of falling into a local optimal solution. First, an escape mechanism was proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation of the algorithm. Second, a random elite cooperative guidance strategy was used to utilize the elite population to guide the general population to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, the dual-path differential perturbation strategy is used to continuously perturb the population using two differential variational operators to enrich population diversity. EDSCSO obtained the best average fitness for 27 of 39 test functions in the IEEE CEC2017 and IEEE CEC2019 test suites, indicating that the algorithm is an efficient and feasible solution for complex optimization problems. In addition, EDSCSO is applied to optimize the three-dimensional wireless sensor network coverage as well as the unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problem, and it provides optimal solutions for both problems. The applicability of EDSCSO in real-world optimization scenarios was verified. © 2024 Author(s).","","Global optimization; Interpolation; Motion planning; Optimization algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Swarm intelligence; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wireless sensor networks; Complex functions; Dual path; Elite populations; Escape mechanism; Exploration and exploitation; General population; Guidance strategy; Local optimal solution; Swarm optimization; Swarm optimization algorithms; algorithm; article; controlled study; diagnosis; human; pharmacology; sand; unmanned aerial vehicle; velocity; Antennas","J.

However, the execution of prolonged tasks poses a heightened challenge owing to the constrained endurance of UAVs. This paper proposes a model to accurately represent urban scenarios and an unmanned system. Restricted zones, no-fly zones, and building obstructions to the detection range are introduced to make sure the model is realistic enough. We also introduced an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) into the model to solve the endurance of the UAVs in this long-time task scenario. The UGV and UAVs constituted a heterogeneous unmanned system to collaboratively solve the path-planning problem in the model. Building upon this model, this paper designs a Three-stage Alternating Optimization Algorithm (TAOA), involving two crucial steps of prediction and rolling optimization. A three-stage scheme is introduced to rolling optimization to effectively address the complex optimization process for the unmanned system. Finally, the TAOA was experimentally validated in both synthetic scenarios and scenarios modeled based on a real-world location to demonstrate their reliability. The experiments conducted in the synthetic scenarios aimed to assess the algorithm under hypothetical conditions, while the experiments in the scenarios based on real-world locations provided a practical evaluation of the proposed methods in more complex and authentic environments. The consistent performance observed across these experiments underscores the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approaches, supporting their potential applicability in various real-world scenarios. © 2024 by the authors.","obstacle avoidance; path planning; UAV; UGV; urban scenarios","Aerial photography; Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Disaster prevention; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Materials handling; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Alternating optimizations; Obstacles avoidance; Optimization algorithms; Real-world; Rolling optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned ground vehicle; Unmanned system; Urban scenarios; Motion planning","J.

A dynamic priority model is constructed through a comprehensive consideration of the indices such as collision risk, total distance, and waiting time. Under the priority-based unilateral collision avoidance mechanism, a combined avoidance strategy is customized to handle local conflicts, so as to bal⁃ ance the planning efficiency and route quality. For individual path planning, a congestion weighted map is introduced into the Lazy Theta* algorithm to guide UAV to avoid congested areas and reduce the conflict possibility. Comparative simulation experiments show that the proposed individual planning algorithm can reduce congestion areas and conges⁃ tion duration, and the proposed multi-index dynamic priority cooperative planning algorithm can improve planning effi⁃ ciency and route optimality compared to the flight-time driven dynamic priority. © 2024 Chinese Society of Astronautics.

Traditional methods show limitations in dealing with these complex nonlinear models. To address these challenges, the swarm intelligence algorithm is introduced as a metaheuristic method and effectively implemented. However, existing technology exhibits drawbacks such as slow convergence speed, low precision, and poor robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel metaheuristic approach called the Red-billed Blue Magpie Optimizer (RBMO), inspired by the cooperative and efficient predation behaviors of red-billed blue magpies. The mathematical model of RBMO was established by simulating the searching, chasing, attacking prey, and food storage behaviors of the red-billed blue magpie. To demonstrate RBMO’s performance, we first conduct qualitative analyses through convergence behavior experiments. Next, RBMO’s numerical optimization capabilities are substantiated using CEC2014 (Dim = 10, 30, 50, and 100) and CEC2017 (Dim = 10, 30, 50, and 100) suites, consistently achieving the best Friedman mean rank. In UAV path planning applications (two-dimensional and three − dimensional), RBMO obtains preferable solutions, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving NP-hard problems. Additionally, in five engineering design problems, RBMO consistently yields the minimum cost, showcasing its advantage in practical problem-solving. We compare our experimental results with three categories of widely recognized algorithms: (1) advanced variants, (2) recently proposed algorithms, and (3) high-performance optimizers, including CEC winners. © The Author(s) 2024.","2D and 3D UAV path planning; Artificial intelligence; Engineering design problems; NP-hard problems; Numerical optimization; Red-billed blue magpie optimizer","Computational complexity; Cost engineering; Food storage; Motion planning; Optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 2d and 3d unmanned aerial vehicle path planning; Aerial vehicle; Engineering design problems; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Numerical optimizations; Optimizers; Performance; Planning designs; Red-billed blue magpie optimizer; Vehicle path planning; Antennas","H.

The goal is to acquire a set of periodically visited surveillance nodes while minimizing the traveling distance. Some expected key problems are the limitations of UAV speed, UGV speed, UAV endurance, and UAV field of view. To address this issue, the path planning of UAV-UGV surveillance system is modeled as a TSP optimization problem based on multiple constraints, aiming to minimize the total path length of the system to perform the task. UAV is responsible for visiting the surveillance node and UGV serves as a mobile charging station.

However, traditional approaches have difficulty balancing convergence and diversity, as well as effectively handling constraints. In this study, a directional evolutionary non-dominated sorting dung beetle optimizer with adaptive stochastic ranking (DENSDBO-ASR) is developed to address these issues in collaborative multi-UAV path planning. Two objectives are initially formulated: the first one represents the total cost of length and altitude, while the second represents the total cost of threat and time. Additionally, an improved multi-objective dung beetle optimizer is introduced, which integrates a directional evolutionary strategy including directional mutation and crossover, thereby accelerating convergence and enhancing global search capability. Furthermore, an adaptive stochastic ranking mechanism is proposed to successfully handle different constraints by dynamically adjusting the comparison probability. The effectiveness and superiority of DENSDBO-ASR are demonstrated by the constrained problem functions (CF) test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Friedman test. Finally, three sets of simulated tests are carried out, each including different numbers of UAVs. In the most challenging scenario, DENSDBO-ASR successfully identifies feasible paths with average values of the two objective functions as low as 637.26 and 0. The comparative results demonstrate that DENSDBO-ASR outperforms the other five algorithms in terms of convergence accuracy and population diversity, making it an exceptional optimization approach to path planning challenges. © 2024 The Authors","Adaptive stochastic ranking mechanism; Cooperative path planning; Directional evolutionary strategy; Multiple UAVs","","D.

Each UAV made online decision on trajectory planning by sensing the received interference signal strength (RISS) values, and then transmitted the sensing information and decision-making actions to the MAV to obtain the global evaluation.

To address this issue, a transmitter localization method based on cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning is proposed. Firstly, a single UAV is used as a cooperative target to establish the localization model and measurement equation in a two-dimensional scenario, and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is employed for solution. Then, an optimization function is constructed by integrating Fisher information and control parameter constraints to dynamically plan the UAV trajectory, thereby improving the accuracy of transmitter localization and the practicality of this method. Finally, simulation experiments show that under the maximum control distance constraint, the positioning result of the proposed method is better than that of straight-line track and typical optimized track, and the final positioning accuracy is less than the standard deviation of the bistatic distance difference measurements, which can meet the application requirements of the passive radar system. © 2024 Science Press.

However, the existing UAV trajectory planning methods have the limitations of high cost and low intelligence. In view of this, grey Wolf algorithm is being used to achieve collaborative trajectory optimization of UAV groups. However, it is found that the Grey Wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) has the problem of weak cooperation. In this study, based on the traditional GWO pheromone factor is introduced to improve it. Aiming at the problem of unstable performance of swarm intelligence optimization algorithm under dynamic threat, deep reinforcement learning is used to optimize the model. An unmanned aerial vehicle swarm trajectory planning model was constructed based on the improved grey wolf algorithm. Through experimental analysis, the optimal fitness value of the improved grey wolf algorithm was lower than 0.43 of the grey wolf algorithm. Compared with other algorithms, the fitness value of this algorithm is significantly reduced and the stability is higher. In complex scenarios, the improved grey wolf algorithm had a trajectory length of 70.51 km and a planning time of 5.92 s, which was clearly superior to other algorithms. The path length planned by the research and design model was 58.476 km, which was significantly smaller than the other three models. The planning time was 5.33 s and the number of path extension points was 46. The indicator values of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle swarm trajectory planning model designed by this research were all smaller than the other three models. By analyzing the results, the model can achieve low-cost trajectory optimization, providing more reasonable technical support for unmanned aerial vehicle mission execution. © The Author(s) 2024.","Deep reinforcement learning; Grey wolf algorithm; Swarm intelligence optimization; Track planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle","pheromone; algorithm; article; Canis lupus; controlled study; deep reinforcement learning; diagnosis; drug development; human; intelligence; unmanned aerial vehicle","J.

Our approach leverages dual learning systems that combine individual agent autonomy with centralized strategic planning, thus enhancing the efficiency of cooperative path planning missions. This framework is designed for high performance in environments with fault uncertainty detected and operational challenges such as interruptions in connectivity and compromised sensor reliability. With the integration of an innovative communication system between agents, our system appropriately handles both static and dynamic environments. Also, we introduce similarity-based shared experience replay to attain faster convergence and sample efficiency in the multi-agent system. The architecture is specially designed to respond adaptively to such irregularities by effectively showing enhanced resilience in scenarios where data integrity is impaired due to faults or the UAV faces disruptions. Simulation results indicate that our fault tolerance algorithms are very resilient and do indeed improve mission outcomes, especially under dynamic and highly uncertain operating conditions. This approach becomes critical for the most recent sensor-based research in autonomous systems. © 2024 by the authors.","coverage path planning; fault-tolerant; multi-agent systems; reinforcement learning","Aircraft communication; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Strategic planning; Aerial vehicle; Central control; Centralised; Coverage path planning; Fault-tolerant; Individual agent; Learning frameworks; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multiagent systems (MASs); Reinforcement learnings; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","M.A. Amiri Atashgah; College of Interdisciplinary Science and Technologies, University of Tehran, Tehran, North Kargar StreetP.O.

A novel fusion localization method is proposed. It couples dual Payload-Carrying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques. This method aims to improve the system's search range and payload capacity. The paper utilizes SLAM technology to achieve self-motion estimation, reducing dependence on external devices. It incorporates a collaborative SLAM backend that provides the necessary information for system navigation, path planning, and motion control, ensuring consistent localization coordinates among the UAVs. Then, a joint localization optimization method based on Kalman filtering is introduced. By fusing the localization information from the visual sensors located beneath the UAVs and using the baseline variation between the 2 UAVs as a reference, the method employs a recursive prediction approach to jointly optimize the self-estimated states and the collaborative SLAM state estimates. Experimental validation demonstrates a 31.6% improvement in localization accuracy in complex tasks compared to non-fusion localization method. Furthermore, to address the cooperative trajectory tracking problem of UAVs after system path planning, a baseline-predicting fuzzy Proportional-Integral-Derivative flight controller is designed. Compared to conventional methods, this controller takes into account delays and system oscillations, achieving better tracking performance and dynamic adjustments.

Planning using UAVs for inspections and repair works puts forward a requirement of improving time efficiency in large-scale and cluster environments. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-UAV cooperative framework for infrastructure inspection and reconstruction to balance the workload and reduce the overall task completion time. The proposed framework consists of two stages, the exploration stage and the exploitation stage, resolving the task in a sequential manner. At the exploration stage, the density map is developed to update global and local information for dynamic load-balanced area partition based on reconstructability and relative positions of UAVs, and the Voronoi-based planner is used to enable the UAVs to reach their best region. After obtaining the global map, viewpoints are generated and divided while taking into account the battery capacity of each UAV. Finally, a shortest path planning method is used to minimize the total traveling cost of these viewpoints for obtaining a high-quality reconstruction. Several experiments are conducted in both a simulated and real environment to show the time efficiency, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, safe and effective path planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the cramped environment is always challenging: conflicts with each other are frequent because of high-density flight paths, collision probability increases because of space constraints, and the search space increases significantly, including time scale, 3D scale and model scale. Thus, this paper proposes a hierarchical collaborative planning framework with a conflict avoidance module at the high level and a path generation module at the low level. The enhanced conflict-base search (ECBS) in our framework is improved to handle the conflicts in the global path planning and avoid the occurrence of local deadlock. And both the collision and kinematic models of UAVs are considered to improve path smoothness and flight safety. Moreover, we specifically designed and published the cramped environment test set containing various unique obstacles to evaluating our framework performance thoroughly. Experiments are carried out relying on Rviz, with multiple flight missions: random, opposite, and staggered, which showed that the proposed method can generate smooth cooperative paths without conflict for at least 60 UAVs in a few minutes.

In this paper，path planning for cooperative patrol coverage of fixed wing UAV in complex mountain environment is studied. Different from previous studies that focus on using UAV to achieve complete coverage of the whole area，the focus of this paper is on multiple UAVs’collaborative patrol of the mission area to ensure that all locations in the area can be continuously visited by UAVs. In previous studies，the cooperative mode of UAVs is to cover each subarea separately，while in this study，multiple UAVs work cooperatively in the whole area，so as to deal with emergencies more flexibly on the basis of improving coverage efficiency. To meet the need to visit the target area in a short time in emergency situations，a strategy of dynamic target points and a small-scale crossing coverage algorithm are designed to ensure that the UAV selected for emergency tasks can reach the target area within a specified time while keep the efficiency of normal patrol task，and can also achieve complete coverage of the target area. Finally，simulations are carried out to verify the feasibility and optimization effect of the algorithm proposed in the reconnaissance coverage task.

However, how to improve the distribution efficiency with low operating costs, and mitigate environmental pollution with high service quality is still a significant challenge in the practical industry applications. To address the above challenge, in this paper, we take into account both the economic cost and environmental cost, and propose a joint distribution path planning model based on neural architecture search (NAS) for electric vehicles with double-decked drones. More specifically, in our design, the factors such as energy consumption and carbon emissions of vehicles and drones during different distribution stages are considered. Then, a mixed integer linear programming model is established under the constraints of customer time window, vehicle capacity and vehicle battery capacity. Based on this model, a hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem, where the carbon emission cost is estimated by the convolution neural network model, which is optimized by the neural architecture search technique. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that, compared with CPLEX, the proposed method excelled in both solution quality and speed, which verify the effectives of our hybrid algorithm in dealing with the 2E-VRPD problem, where delivery routes can be well optimized, the efficiency of vehicle-machine collaborative delivery can be improved, and delivery costs are reduced. © The Author(s) 2024.","Convolution neural network model; Hybrid genetic algorithm; Large-scale neighborhood search; Vehicle routing problem with drones","","X.

In view of the problem of coordinated detection by multi-UAVs, the region division and global coverage path planning of the stereo space to be detected are studied. A whale optimization algorithm based on the simulated annealing-whale optimization algorithm (SA-WOA) is proposed, which introduces adaptive weights with the Levy flight mechanism, improves the metropolis criterion, and introduces an adaptive tempering mechanism in the SA stage. Path smoothing is subsequently performed with the help of nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves. The comparison of algorithms using the eil76 dataset shows that the path length planned by the SA-WOA algorithm in this paper is 10.15% shorter than that of the WOA algorithm, 13.25% shorter than the SA planning result, and only 0.95% difference from the optimal path length in the dataset. From the perspective of planning time, its speed is similar to WOA, with a relative speed increase of 27.15% compared to SA, proving that the algorithm proposed in this paper has good planning performance. A hardware system platform is designed and built, and environmental gas measurement experiments were conducted.

However, the limited battery capacity of a single UAV limits its application in many situations, such as searching in wild areas. In this article, we propose a computational scheme of cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAVs based on Voronoi diagrams and intelligent swarm optimization algorithm. In this article: 1) Voronoi diagrams are used to model the field environment according to the radar sensor position; 2) an improved K-medoids algorithm based on the maximum empty circle property of the Voronoi diagram (Vor-K$-medoids) is proposed to complete the reconnaissance UAVs (RUAVs) domain cooperative search; and 3) a hyperbolic tangent heuristic function intelligent optimization algorithm is proposed to calculate the minimum risk path for the attack UAV (AUAV) according to the characteristics of the attack mission. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme integrates the properties of the Voronoi diagram, clustering algorithm, and path planning algorithm commendably. Compared with the traditional ant colony optimization (ACO), under the same number of iterations, the probability of obtaining the optimal track is improved by 14%, and the running time is shortened by 50.87%.The proposed scheme offers a practical and cost-effective approach for efficiently searching areas within large-scale radar sensors in real-world scenarios.  © 2014 IEEE.","Ant colony optimization (ACO); K-medoids; path planning; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); voronoi","Ant colony optimization; Antennas; Clustering algorithms; Cost effectiveness; Drones; Graphic methods; Heuristic algorithms; Wireless sensor networks; Aerial vehicle; Battery capacity; Cluster planning; Heuristics algorithm; K-medoids; Radar sensors; Task analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Voronoi; Voronoi diagrams; Motion planning","S.

Addressing the high demands for timeliness in practical communication scenarios, this paper investigates multi-UAV collaborative path planning, focusing on the minimization of weighted average Age of Information (AoI) for IoT devices. To address this challenge, the multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient with dual experience pools and particle swarm optimization (DP-MATD3) algorithm is presented. The objective is to train multiple UAVs to autonomously search for optimal paths, minimizing the AoI. Firstly, considering the relatively slow learning speed and susceptibility to local minima of neural network algorithms, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized for parameter optimization of the multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) neural network. Secondly, with the introduction of the dual experience pools mechanism, the efficiency of network training is significantly improved. Experimental results show DP-MATD3 outperforms MATD3 in average weighted AoI.

One significant challenge is ensuring the timely and efficient transmission of data generated by these sensor nodes back to the base station. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide a practical solution to this challenge by acting as mobile relay nodes for facilitating data transmission. In most existing works, UAVs are typically restricted to collecting data within their designated areas and returning to the base station for data offloading, resulting in suboptimal data timeliness due to long-distance flights. A limited number of works have explored the utilization of relay collaboration by UAVs for data collection, enabling efficient and immediate transmission of sensor node data to the base station. Nevertheless, UAVs positioned at significant distances from the base station face challenges in obtaining timely energy replenishment. This makes them unable to effectively support long-duration data collection missions. In order to tackle these challenges, we develop a UAV-aided IoT collaborative data collection mechanism and propose a matching games-based data collection (MGDC) scheme. In this scheme, we begin by identifying convergence nodes within the ground sensor network, responsible for uploading sensor-generated data to passing UAVs. Furthermore, we divide the mission area into multiple subareas based on the number of available UAVs. Subsequently, using a matching game algorithm, we establish relay relationships between UAVs to enable efficient relay transmissions among paired UAVs. To achieve efficient data collection of UAVs, we employ an improved adaptive large neighborhood search (IALNS) algorithm for UAV flight path planning. Finally, we incorporate an alternating charging mode to ensure all UAVs have the opportunity to return to the base station for energy recharge. Through comprehensive experimentation, we confirm the significant enhancement provided by our proposed data collection scheme compared to existing schemes. This scheme effectively reduces system age of information (AoI) and extends the runtime of the system. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Age of information; Alternating charging; Data collection; Internet of Things; Unmanned aerial vehicle","","X.

Firstly, using the target probability distribution map, two strategies of information fusion and information diffusion are employed to solve the problem of environmental information inconsistency caused by different UAVs searching different areas, thereby improving the coordination of UAV groups. Secondly, the task region is decomposed into several high-value sub-regions by using data clustering method. Based on this, a hierarchical search strategy is proposed, which allows precise or rough search in different probability areas by adjusting the altitude of the aircraft, thereby improving the search efficiency. Third, the Elite Dung Beetle Optimization Algorithm (EDBOA) is proposed based on bionics by accurately simulating the social behavior of dung beetles to plan paths that satisfy the UAV dynamics constraints and adapt to the mountainous terrain, where the mountain is considered as an obstacle to be avoided. Finally, the objective function for path optimization is formulated by considering factors such as coverage within the task region, smoothness of the search path, and path length.

Traditional task allocation algorithms often perform poorly when dealing with issues such as local optima, slow convergence speed, and low convergence accuracy, making it difficult to meet the demands for efficiency and practicality in real-world applications. To address these problems, this paper focuses on collaborative task allocation technology for multi-UAV. It proposes a collaborative task allocation strategy for multi-UAV in a multi-target environment, which comprehensively considers various complex constraints in practical application scenarios. The strategy utilizes Dubins curves for trajectory planning and constructs a multi-UAV collaborative task allocation model, with targets including the shortest total distance index, the minimum time index, and the trajectory coordination index. Each UAV is set as an artificial dragonfly by modifying the traditional dragonfly algorithm, incorporating differential evolution algorithms and their crossover, mutation, and selection operations to bring UAV swarms closer to the characteristics of biological dragonflies. The modifications can enhance the global scalability of artificial dragonfly swarms (ADSs), including wider search capacity, wider speed range, and more diverse search accuracy. Meanwhile, potential solutions with global convergence properties are stored to better support real-time adjustments to task allocation. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can generate a conflict-free task execution scheme and plan the trajectory, which has advantages in changing the data scale of the UAV and the target and improves the reliability of the system to a certain extent. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial dragonfly swarms; collaborative task allocation; differential evolution algorithm; Dubins curves; multi-UAV","Drones; Artificial dragonfly swarm; Collaborative task allocation; Collaborative tasks; Differential evolution algorithms; Dubin curve; Multi UAV; Sequential task; Task allocation; Task executions; UAV systems","Y.

Existing methods often suffer from suboptimal trajectories or computation burden. In this paper, we address cooperative trajectory planning of aerial-ground systems in which an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) plans its local trajectory in real-time with the assistance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Firstly, the UAV generates guidance trajectory using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which considers the obstacle distribution density as a factor reflecting the coupling effect of multiple obstacles on the UGV, thereby avoiding local minima problem and improving the feasibility of the planned trajectory. Secondly, a null-space-based behavioral control (NSBC) framework is employed to merge the guidance trajectory into the UGV’s own planned one as a task. Finally, an event triggering task supervisor is developed for the UGV to decide the priorities of all tasks, which reduces the switching frequency of task priorities brought by traditional rule-based task supervisors. Both simulation and experiment results show that the proposed approach has superior trajectory planning performance in terms of trajectory error, on-line computation time and the success rate of task execution. © 2024, The Author(s).","Aerial-ground systems; Behavioral control; Model predictive control; Trajectory planning","Air navigation; Antennas; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Real time systems; Supervisory personnel; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Aerial-ground system; Behavioral control; Computation burden; Distribution density; Ground systems; Model-predictive control; Nonlinear model predictive control; Real- time; Trajectory Planning; Model predictive control","J.

The algorithm design of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods has become integral to research on multi-UAV target search owing to its adaptability to the rapid online decision-making required by UAVs in complex, uncertain environments. In non-cooperative target search scenarios, targets may have the ability to escape. Target probability maps are used in many studies to characterize the likelihood of a target’s existence, guiding the UAV to efficiently explore the task area and locate the target more quickly. However, the escape behavior of the target causes the target probability map to deviate from the actual target’s position, thereby reducing its effectiveness in measuring the target’s probability of existence and diminishing the efficiency of the UAV search. This paper investigates the multi-UAV target search problem in scenarios involving static obstacles and dynamic escape targets, modeling the problem within the framework of decentralized partially observable Markov decision process. Based on this model, a spatio-temporal efficient exploration network and a global convolutional local ascent mechanism are proposed. Subsequently, we introduce a multi-UAV Escape Target Search algorithm based on MAPPO (ETS–MAPPO) for addressing the escape target search difficulty problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the ETS–MAPPO algorithm outperforms five classic MARL algorithms in terms of the number of target searches, area coverage rate, and other metrics. © 2024 by the authors.","area coverage path planning; escape target search; multi-agent reinforcement learning; multi-UAV","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Markov processes; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Area coverage path planning; Area coverages; Coverage path planning; Escape target search; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle; Reinforcement learning method; Target search; Vehicle targets; algorithm; article; benchmarking; escape behavior; human; learning; Markov decision process; probability; simulation; therapy; unmanned aerial vehicle; Reinforcement learning","J.

This work introduces an energy-efficient framework using a multi-objective PathFinder algorithm designed to simultaneously handle transmission coordination between drones and IoT devices. The proposed approach facilitates collaborative decision-making for route planning and resource allocation by utilizing the Collaborative Index, which measures cooperative behavior among network nodes, emphasizing key node cooperativeness parameters. Furthermore, a multi-objective fitness function was constructed for effective path planning using the Collaboration Index of nodes in the path and the QoS of the path. To validate the efficacy of the proposed model, a series of simulations were conducted focusing on key performance indicators such as energy consumption, data delay, and task completion rates against existing state-of-the-art methods. © by the authors.","path planning; trajectory optimization; UAV-IoT network","","S.

It aims to improve the efficiency of task execution and regional coverage of air-ground unmanned systems by combining the characteristics of the wide field of vision of unmanned aerial vehicles and the strong mobility of unmanned ground vehicles.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown success in connecting rural and remote areas due to the high cost of deploying infrastructures like cellular network base stations and optical fiber connections in vast landscapes with sparse populations. The constrained energy of UAVs results in limited coverage area and flight time, which in turn reduces the potential of UAVs to provide task-oriented wireless communication links. In this article, we explore path optimization and transmission organization algorithms to minimize flight time and extend the range of UAVs performing collaborative federated learning (FL) among geographically dispersed nodes communicating through wireless connections offered by UAVs coupled with device-to-device (D2D) networks. The UAV orchestrates FL between spatially scattered homes via long-range radio wireless communication. We formulate the drone path optimization as a traveling salesman problem (TSP) and employ self-organizing maps (SOM) for path planning. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD)-based FL is used to reduce communication overhead for the resource-constrained UAV-IoT system. Experimental results demonstrate SOM's ability to represent the topological structure of nodes and produce a cost-efficient Hamiltonian cycle, from which the drone path is derived. Our results demonstrate the communication efficiency and utility of KD-based FL compared to model-based FL methods. The proposed hybrid solution enables energy-constrained UAVs to perform FL over large areas leveraging a shared data set for KD and a SOM-based path optimization algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","Federated learning (FL); human activity recognition (HAR); knowledge distillation (KD); self-organizing map (SOM); unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path optimization","5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Autonomous vehicles; Conformal mapping; Constrained optimization; Distillation; Drones; Hamiltonians; Large dataset; Motion planning; Optical fibers; Self organizing maps; Traveling salesman problem; Aerial vehicle; Federated learning; Human activity recognition; Knowledge distillation; Optimisations; Path optimizations; Self-organizing feature map; Self-organizing map; Self-organizing-maps; Unmanned aerial vehicle path optimization; Internet of things","M.M.

Despite their potential, optimizing UAV missions in complex and unstructured environments remains a pivotal challenge. Path planning becomes a crucial aspect to increase mission efficiency, although it is inherently complex due to various factors such as obstacles, no-fly zones, non-cooperative aircraft, and flight mechanics limitations. This paper presents a path-planning technique for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the Theta* algorithm. The approach introduces innovative features, such as the use of Euler spiral, or clothoids, to serve as connection arcs between nodes, mitigating trajectory discontinuities. The design of clothoids can be linked to the aircraft performance model, establishing a connection between curvature constraints and the specific characteristics of the vehicle. Furthermore, to lower the computational burden, the implementation of an adaptive exploration distance and a vision cone was considered, reducing the number of explored solutions. This methodology ensures a seamless and optimized flight path for fixed-wing UAVs operating in static environments, showcasing a noteworthy improvement in trajectory smoothness.

Path planning for UAV swarms is a challenging task depending upon the environmental conditions, the limitations of fixed-wing UAVs and the swarm constraints. Multiple optimization techniques have been studied for path-planning problems. However, there are local optimum and convergence rate problems. This study aims to propose a multi-UAV cooperative path planning (CoPP) scheme with four-dimensional collision avoidance and simultaneous arrival time. Design/methodology/approach: A new two-step optimization algorithm is developed based on multiple populations (MP) of disturbance-based modified grey-wolf optimizer (DMGWO). The optimization is performed based on the objective function subject to multi constraints, including collision avoidance, same minimum time of flight and threat and obstacle avoidance in the terrain while meeting the UAV constraints. Comparative simulations using two different algorithms are performed to authenticate the proposed DMGWO. Findings: The critical features of the proposed MP-DMGWO-based CoPP algorithm are local optimum avoidance and rapid convergence of the solution, i.e. fewer iterations as compared to the comparative algorithms. The efficiency of the proposed method is evident from the comparative simulation results. Originality/value: A new algorithm DMGWO is proposed for the CoPP problem of UAV swarm. The local best position of each wolf is used in addition to GWO. Besides, a disturbance is introduced in the best solutions for faster convergence and local optimum avoidance. The path optimization is performed based on a newly designed objective function that depends upon multiple constraints. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","4D collision avoidance; Cooperative path planning; Grey wolf optimizer; GWO; Multi-UAV system","Air cushion vehicles; Aircraft accidents; Flight simulators; Optimization algorithms; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 4d collision avoidance; Aerial vehicle; Collisions avoidance; Cooperative path planning; Gray wolf optimizer; Gray wolves; GWO; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle system; Optimizers; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; Motion planning","Z.

While individual UAVs encounter limitations, such as endurance constraints, these challenges can be mitigated through collaborative efforts involving multiple vehicles and UAVs. This study addresses the issue of multi-UAV cooperative orchard path planning with multiple vehicles by formulating a mathematical optimization model aimed at minimizing the maximum UAV operation time. In the proposed model, the vehicle solely provides batteries and supplies to the UAV. To efficiently solve this model, we propose an improved Simulated Annealing-Lin Kernighan Helsgaun (SA-LKH) algorithm. The proposed algorithm utilizes the K-means and convex hull algorithm to generate the initial solution. Subsequently, the paths of each group of UAVs and vehicles are optimized based on the LKH algorithm. Additionally, we construct a directed perturbation operator that perturbs the maximum and minimum time-consuming paths to achieve fast convergence of the algorithm. The results from four different cases demonstrate that, compared to the general variable neighborhood search algorithm, the improved Ant Colony Algorithm and Improved Genetic Algorithm, the proposed algorithm has demonstrated an average improvement in solution quality of 3.41%, 5.72% and 9.67%, respectively.

This paper proposes a monitoring scheme based on the synergistic operation of motherships and UAVs. This scheme innovatively adopts a harbor sea patrol vessel or the other official vessel (mothership) as the mobile power supply base for UAVs and realizes efficient and accurate monitoring of vessel air pollution in the pre-monitored area at sea by carrying multiple UAVs. The focus of this paper is on the path optimization problem for multi-UAV collaboration with mothership (MUCWM) monitoring, where the objective is to minimize the total monitoring time for MUCWM. The following three main aspects are studied in this paper: (1) multi-UAV monitoring path optimization; (2) the collaboration mechanism between the mothership and multiple UAVs; and (3) mothership traveling path optimization. In order to effectively solve the above problems, this thesis constructs a path optimization model for multi-UAV collaborative mothership monitoring of air pollution from vessels in port waters; solves the model using the improved adaptive differential evolution (IADE) algorithm; and verifies the effectiveness of the model and the algorithm by using the position data in the Automatic Identification System (AIS) of vessels in Ningbo Zhoushan Port. Through the performance comparison and sensitivity analysis of the algorithm, it is confirmed that the algorithm can effectively solve the path planning problem of the collaborative operation between the mothership and multiple UAVs. The research results in this paper not only help to reduce the air pollution level of harbor vessels and improve the efficiency of sea cruising but also play an important supporting role in the enforcement of relevant emission regulations. © 2024 by the authors.","collaborative mechanism; differential evolution algorithm; path optimization; UAVs; vessel atmospheric pollution","China; Ningbo; Zhejiang; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; genetic algorithm; optimization; performance assessment; research work; unmanned vehicle","L.

The dynamic of these plumes, which may be important due to meteorological conditions, makes their study difficult. Real-time monitoring in order to obtain an accurate mapping of the pollution dispersion is helpful and valuable to mitigate risks. In this work, we consider a fleet of cooperative drones carrying pollution sensors and operating in order to assess a pollution plume. The latter is assumed to follow a Gaussian process (GP) with varying parameters. For this use case, we propose an efficient approach to characterize spatially and temporarily the plume while optimizing the path planning of drones. In our approach, drones are guided by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model called the categorical deep Q -network (Categorical DQN) to maximize the plume coverage while considering budget constraints. Specifically, we develop a scalable independent Q -learning (IQL) scheme that shares team rewards based on each drone's deployment relevance and, therefore, ensures cooperation. We evaluate the performance of the plume parameter estimation as well as the maps generated by the GP regression. By testing our framework on several plume scenarios, we show that it offers good results in terms of both estimation quality and runtime efficiency.  © 2014 IEEE.","Drone fleet; Gaussian process (GP); independent Q-learning (IQL); multiagent informative path planning (MIPP); pollution plume monitoring; reinforcement learning (RL)","Budget control; Deep learning; Drones; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Internet of things; Motion planning; Pollution detection; Reinforcement learning; Drone fleet; Gaussian Processes; Heuristics algorithm; Independent Q-learning; Multi agent; Multi-agent informative path planning; Pollution measurement; Pollution plume monitoring; Pollution plumes; Q-learning; Reinforcement learnings; Trajectory Planning; Heuristic algorithms","M.S.

The two methodological pillars,carefully chosen for their unique contributions,play a pivotal role in steering unmanned swarm systems toward heightened efficiency and adaptability across diverse environments. First,the implementation of cooperative control stands as a cornerstone,fostering enhanced communication and collaboration among agents within the unmanned swarm system. This strategic approach not only minimizes conflicts but also streamlines tasks,contributing substantially to the augmentation of system efficiency. Cooperative control establishes a foundation for improved information exchange and seamless cooperation by promoting a cohesive environment where agents work in tandem. Second,the integration of game control methodologies plays a pivotal role in empowering agents to navigate conflicts of interest effectively. This approach goes beyond conflict resolution;it actively contributes to elevating decision-making processes and optimizing the overall interests of the cluster system. The dynamic nature of game control ensures that agents can strategically navigate complex scenarios,maximizing collective interests and ensuring the sustained efficiency of the unmanned swarm system. Additionally, in practical large-scale problems,a balanced combination of cooperation and games enhances the adaptive capabilities of intelligent system clusters in diverse environments. This approach effectively resolves conflicts of interest and decision-making challenges that may arise between agents. Regarding the implementation of the two methods,this study concentrates on utilizing the collaborative control method for tasks such as formation control,cluster path planning,and cluster task collaboration. Specific technical implementations are allocated to corresponding sub-items. The game control methods center around various game types,including self-play,evolutionary play,and reinforcement learning play. These approaches offer new prospects for addressing optimization challenges in cluster control. This study comprehensively reviews the application of cooperative and game control methods in the unmanned swarm system. Explicit explanations of fundamental concepts,including agents,swarm intelligence,and unmanned swarm systems,are provided to establish a basic understanding for readers. Subsequently,the mathematical models of cooperative and game control,swarm cooperation and game decisions,swarm cooperative control methods,swarm game control methods,and other algorithms are introduced. The emphasis is placed on the theoretical foundations of cooperative decision-making and game control,along with their applications in improving overall system performance in the unmanned swarm system. Furthermore,the paper delves into illustrative application scenarios,providing concrete examples of how swarm cooperation and game control methodologies find practical relevance across diverse fields. These exemplary cases span a spectrum of industries,including intelligent transportation,unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV)formation,logistics and distribution,and military domains. The paper offers valuable insights into the versatility and adaptability of unmanned swarm systems by demonstrating the tangible applications of these technologies in real-world settings. Finally,the paper discusses future research directions and challenges,emphasizing the necessity for new technologies and methods to address evolving needs and problems. The highlighted complex challenges,including the intricacy of large-scale swarm systems,collaboration among heterogeneous agents,adaptability to dynamic environments,autonomy of clusters,interpretability and safety of unmanned swarm systems,and self-healing capability,undoubtedly serve as key research focal points for future unmanned systems. Overall, this paper serves as a comprehensive guide and reference,not only delving into the theoretical foundations but also providing practical insights into the application of cooperative decision-making and game control in unmanned swarm systems. The forward-looking approach of this paper positions it as a valuable resource for those seeking to advance the field,foster development and innovation,and contribute to the ongoing scientific and technological progress in this domain. ©中国图象图形学报版权所有","cooperative control; game control; intelligent decision; reinforcement learning(RL); unmanned swarm systems(USS)","","X.

However, it remains a challenge to plan the mission of Relay UAVs (RUs) to enhance communication of the swarm considering the kinematics of UAVs and task sequences of a swarm. This paper proposes a two-layer relay planning framework for a fixed-wing UAV swarm consisting of coarse planning at the Ground Control Station (GCS) as well as refined trajectory planning onboard. The GCS planning layer evaluates the relay requirements in the swarm network to generate the initial deployment of RUs, aiming to minimize their numbers while maximizing utility. The beta-weak connectivity model is adopted to evaluate the swarm network topology constructed from the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Meanwhile, a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Problem (MINLP) is employed to determine the initial deployment of RUs including the number and accessing locations. Moreover, the onboard planning layer predicts the states of the Mission UAVs (MUs) connected to the RU using the Kalman filter. Based on these predictions, the trajectories of each RU are autonomously planned online to continuously guarantee stable network connectivity, which is achieved through Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC). Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","collaborative communication; distributed model predictive control; network connectivity; relay UAV; trajectory planning; UAV swarm","Antennas; Cooperative communication; Electric power transmission; Integer programming; Job analysis; Model predictive control; Nonlinear programming; Numerical methods; Rock mechanics; Topology; Trajectories; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicle transmissions; Aerial vehicle; Collaborative communications; Distributed Model predictive Control; Network connectivity; Relay; Relay unmanned aerial vehicle; Task analysis; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","C.

Firstly，for the UAV“individual”，the conflict be⁃ tween UAVs and urban static environment targets is considered，and a three-dimensional path planning method based on probabilistic risk maps is constructed to achieve the initial generation of UAV flight plan. Then，for the UAV “group”，considering the conflict between UAVs，a multi-type conflict cooperative deduction model for UAV flight plan is constructed，and the conflict characteristic indicators such as conflict occurrence rate，conflict risk level，and grid oc⁃ cupancy ratio are designed and metricized. Finally，diversified allocation strategies such as adjusting flight paths，flight speeds，and flight times are designed. Based on the multi-strategy self-adaptive configuration，an optimization and al⁃ location model is established. The optimization performance and parameter sensitivity of the proposed method are verified，demonstrating the optimization performance and parameter sensitivity of urban low-altitude flight plans under different traffic density scenarios. Experiments show that the proposed method can reduce flight plan conflicts by 96. 2% on the basis of effectively controlling the risk cost and time cost，completely conflict free flight plan can be ob⁃ tained for UAV operation scenarios with less than 40 UAVs，and the minimum flight conflict resolution rate for UAVs with less than 100 UAVs can be controlled above 95%. The proposed method is scientific and effective，and can pro⁃ vide a theoretical basis and methodological guidance for safe and efficient management of low-altitude UAV flight activi⁃ ties in complex cities. © 2024 Chinese Society of Astronautics.

However, in some large-scale application problems, the grey wolf optimization algorithm easily gets trapped in local optima, exhibits poor global exploration ability and suffers from premature convergence. Since grey wolf’s update is guided only by the best three wolves, it leads to low population multiplicity and poor global exploration capacity. In response to the above issues, we design a multi-strategy collaborative grey wolf optimization algorithm (NOGWO). Firstly, we use a random walk strategy to extend the exploration scope and enhance the algorithm’s global exploration capacity. Secondly, we add an opposition-based learning model influenced by refraction principle to generate an opposite solution for each population, thereby improving population multiplicity and preventing the algorithm from being attracted to local optima. Finally, to balance local exploration and global exploration and elevate the convergence effect, we introduce a novel convergent factor. We conduct experimental testing on NOGWO by using 30 CEC2017 test functions. The experimental outcomes indicate that compared with GWO and some swarm intelligence algorithms, NOGWO has better global exploration capacity and convergence accuracy. In addition, we also apply NOGWO to three engineering problems and an unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problem. The outcomes of the experiment suggest that NOGWO performs well in solving these practical problems. © 2024 by the authors.","grey wolf optimization algorithm; opposition-based learning; random walk; refraction principle; unmanned aerial vehicle path planning","","P.

In this paper, autonomous undersea vehicles(AUVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) were used for searching and tracking unknown underwater targets in offshore waters. First, the underwater target search and tracking mission was described, and the mission was divided into two stages: target search and target tracking, with the objectives of maximizing the total search space of the AUV&UAV system and minimizing the end position error between the AUV and the underwater target, respectively. Then, a cross-domain collaborative search model of the AUV&UAV system was established, and constraints such as detection range and communication distance for AUVs and UAVs in the model were set. Finally, based on the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm, an adaptive learning factor regulation strategy and an elite preservation strategy were employed for cross-domain collaborative search and tracking path planning, and search and tracking paths were generated. The simulation experiment demonstrates that the heterogeneous AUV&UAV system based on an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm can more efficiently search and track underwater targets. © 2024 Science China Press.

Recently, there has been a growing focus on leveraging UAVs with diverse computing capabilities to enhance the performance of AEC networks through cooperative computing. However, heterogeneity and cooperation introduce a higher degree of coupling between trajectory planning and computing offloading strategy for AEC networks. In particular, the joint decision making in an AEC network needs to balance minimizing the distance between UAVs and access users and enabling collaborative offloading. And this must be done while considering the time-varying computation requirements and the long-term impact on system performance. To address the aforementioned challenges, we formulate an optimization problem to design a joint dynamic cooperative computation offloading and trajectory optimization scheme for the AEC network. The complexity arises from the problem's nature as a mixed-integer nonlinear program. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on QMIX. We leverage both theoretical analysis and an action branching architecture to reduce the complexity of our proposed deep reinforcement algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate a substantial performance improvement over the benchmarks, affirming the effectiveness of our complexity reduction approach.  © 2014 IEEE.","Aerial edge network; heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); multiagent deep reinforcement learning; trajectory planning","Aerodynamics; Antennas; Benchmarking; Complex networks; Computation offloading; Decision making; Deep learning; Integer programming; Internet of things; Job analysis; Learning algorithms; Mobile edge computing; Multi agent systems; Nonlinear programming; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial edge network; Aerial vehicle; Delay; EDGE Networks; Heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle; Multi agent; Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Task analysis; Trajectory optimization; Trajectory Planning; Reinforcement learning","F.

Based on the integrated energy reduction perspective, a bi-objective model is subtly constructed by minimizing the total energy consumption of each path (including flight altitude, horizontal turns, and path length), and minimizing the costs of the total threats (including ground radar, anti-aircraft gun, missile and geological hazard threat areas). Moreover, a two-stage knowledge-assisted coevolutionary NSGA-II algorithm is novelly proposed to enhance collaboration and avoid collision. The first stage is designed for population convergence, where the considered constrained problem is solved with the help of the designed problem without the constraints of threats and obstacles. The second stage emphasizes the quality and diversity of solutions. In this stage, a double-population coevolution approach is developed. Additionally, a multi-mode strategy is introduced for the inferior population, leveraging reinforcement learning. This strategy aids in selecting the optimal mode from random swing, directed guidance, and potential dominance exploration. Furthermore, experimental results in two different environments show that the proposed algorithm can better solve the collaborative path planning problem for multiple UAVs compared with other five classical or recent proposed algorithms. © 2024","Coevolution; Energy consumption; Path planning; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Aircraft accidents; Antennas; Energy utilization; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Bi objectives; Co-evolution; Co-evolutionary; Energy-consumption; Knowledge-assisted; NSGA-II; Path planning problems; Reinforcement learnings; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Motion planning","B.

Deploying sensors to collect data and then utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect the data stored in the sensors has replaced traditional manual data collection as the dominantmethod. The current strategies for efficient data collection in above scenarios are still imperfect, and the low quality of the collected data and the excessive energy consumed by UAV flights are still the main problems faced in data collection.With regards this, this paper proposes a multi-UAV mission planning method for self-organized sensor data acquisition by comprehensively utilizing the techniques of self-organized sensor clustering,multi-UAVmission area allocation, and sub-area data acquisition scheme optimization. The improved α-hop clustering method utilizes the average transmission distance to reduce the size of the collection sensors, and the K-Dimensional method is used to form a multi-UAV cooperative workspace, and then, the genetic algorithm is used to trade-off the speed with the age of information (AoI) of the collected information and the energy consumption to form the multi-UAV data collection operation scheme. The combined optimization scheme in paper improves the performance by 95.56% and 58.21%, respectively, compared to the traditional baseline model. In order to verify the excellent generalization and applicability of the proposed method in real scenarios, the simulation test is conducted by introducing the digital elevation model data of the real terrain, and the results show that the relative error values of the proposed method and the performance test of the actual flight of the UAV are within the error interval of ±10%. Then, the advantages and disadvantages of the present method with the existing mainstream schemes are tested, and the results show that the present method has a huge advantage in terms of space and time complexity, and at the same time, the accuracy for data extraction is relatively improved by 10.46% and 12.71%. Finally, by eliminating the clustering process and the subtask assignment process, the AoI performance decreases by 3.46× and 4.45×, and the energy performance decreases by 3.52×and 4.47×. This paper presents a comprehensive and detailed proactive optimization of the existing challenges faced in the field of data acquisition by means of a series of combinatorial optimizations.  © 2024 The Authors.

This paper studies the path planning problem of UAV swarms, aiming to propose an effective method to improve the efficiency and safety of task execution. The Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) is a popular optimization algorithm known for its high performance. However, it sometimes encounters issues such as low efficiency in spiral flight and slow predator speed, leading to slow convergence and susceptibility to local optima. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Multi-strategy Enhanced Marine Predator Algorithm (MEMPA). The four enhancement strategies are: random spiral flight strategy, crisscross strategy, centroid boundary control strategy, and improved update rules for eddy formation and the FADs' effect. These strategies collectively enhance the algorithm's global search ability and its capacity to escape local optima. Compared with FDB-PPSO, AGWO, HPHHO, LSHADE, LSHADE-cnEpSin, MadDE, NMPA, QQLMPA, and the original MPA across four different dimensions of the 30 CEC2017 test functions, the Wilcoxon rank sum test results show that MEMPA outperforms the original MPA by 21, 19, 22, and 25 on the four dimensions, respectively. According to the results of the Friedman mean rank test, the top three algorithms are LSHADE, MPA, and MEMPA, with scores of 2.91, 2.77, and 2.14, respectively. Additionally, the proposed MEMPA was used to solve the UAV swarm path planning problem. The results show that the solutions obtained by MEMPA are 10%, 10%, and 13% better than those obtained by MPA, NMPA, and QQLMPA, respectively. It is superior to the selected comparison algorithms in terms of solution effectiveness and stability, demonstrating its potential in practical applications. © 2013 IEEE.","centroid boundary control strategy; global optimization; Marine predator algorithm; spiral flight strategy; UAV swarm path planning","Aircraft control; Heuristic methods; Job analysis; Marine applications; Marine safety; Motion planning; Strategic planning; Swarm intelligence; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Boundary controls; Centroid boundary control strategy; Control strategies; Convergence; Global optimisation; Heuristics algorithm; Marine predator algorithm; Metaheuristic; Search problem; Spiral flight strategy; Task analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm path planning; Heuristic algorithms","H.

However, the security issues raised by the open nature of the wireless transmission deserve attention, especially when confronted with cooperative wardens and eavesdroppers. To this end, we consider a new framework for an energy-efficient design of UAV-aided short-packet transmission systems against cooperative hostile detection and eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the false rate of the cooperative hostile detection is first derived by utilizing the likelihood ratio test and the bivariate Gaussian distribution property. Then, we formulate a problem to maximize the minimum covert secrecy energy efficiency (MCSEE) by jointly optimizing the user association, UAV power control, and UAV three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. We propose a penalty-based dual-loop iterative optimization algorithm to tackle this complex problem suboptimally with the aid of auxiliary penalty variables, where the communication resource scheduling, the UAV trajectory planning, and the auxiliary penalty variables are optimized in the inner loop. In particular, the intractable joint UAV power control and 3D trajectory design sub-problem is suboptimally addressed by introducing slack variables and employing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The penalty factor is updated in the outer loop. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed solution to several benchmarks.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","and short-packet communications; covert communications; physical layer security; resource allocation; trajectory design; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Aircraft communication; Benchmarking; Convex optimization; Cooperative communication; Forward error correction; Gaussian distribution; Health risks; Inductive power transmission; Linear programming; Mobile telecommunication systems; Risk analysis; Aerial vehicle; And short-packet communication; Covert communications; Eavesdropping attacks; Physical layer security; Resources allocation; Short packet communication; Short packets; Trajectory designs; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Z.

The problem is typically NP-hard and cannot be easily solved, especially when considering the scale of each area. By decomposing the problem into two cascaded sub-problems&#x2014;1) covering a specific polygon area and 2) determining the optimal visiting order of different areas&#x2014;an approximate solution can be found more efficiently. First, the target areas are approximated as convex polygons, and the coverage pattern is designed based on four control points. Then, the optimal visiting order is determined based on a state defined by area indices and control points. We propose two different optimization methods to solve this problem. The first method is a direct extension of the genetic algorithm, using a customized coding method. The second method is a reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) approach that solves the problem as a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) through end-to-end policy training. The simulation results indicate that the proposed methods can provide solutions to the multiple-area coverage problem with competitive optimality and efficiency.

It then employs Monte Carlo simulation sampling to select and analyze the risk state of the grid system, as well as to determine the overall risk probability of the calculation system and the level of consequence indicators. An improved Dijkstra algorithm is applied to plan the optimal path for UAV grid inspection. Based on the inspection and risk assessment results, work orders are automatically generated and assigned to the corresponding maintenance personnel.

However, existing approaches often decouple the tasks between UAVs and legged robots, for instance, using UAVs for mapping and legged robots for operation. Such feature hinders the realization of collaborative advantages and consequently reduces task completion efficiency. This letter proposes a perception-planning framework for collaborative SAR missions involving UAVs and legged robots. The framework primarily utilizes UAVs to efficiently search for target objects in unknown environments, while also determining a feasible path for the legged robots to reach the targets. More specifically, the UAV employs an optimized frontier-based exploration method to explore unknown environments. Simultaneously, a depth-first reachable search tree is utilized to swiftly assess the traversability of the guided path of the legged robot, thereby accelerating the exploration process. After locating the target, the method further constrains the exploration area based on permissible ellipses until an the shortest path is found. The proposed approach is evaluated through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios and the results demonstrate that our approach exhibits significantly higher exploration efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, reducing completion times in SAR tasks by over 18.3%.  © 2024 IEEE.","Legged robots; motion and path planning; multi-robot systems","Collaborative robots; Geological surveys; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Job analysis; Motion planning; Multipurpose robots; Robot programming; Trees (mathematics); Aerial vehicle; Backtracking; Collaboration; Legged locomotion; Legged robots; Motion and path planning; Multi-robot systems; Search and rescue; Search missions; Task analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","P.

To be able to perform the same tasks in an indoor environment their trajectories have to be planned precisely, i.e., their dynamics have to be taken into account. They do not only need to keep safety distances to fixed obstacles such as walls or furniture but also to moving obstacles, e.g., moving machine parts or a person. Additionally, the UAVs in the swarm should perform the mission cooperatively without staying closely together covering only a small part of the area. Therefore, path or trajectory planning is of great interest. Path planning for multiple agents of a swarm is still a very challenging task. Especially when a priori unknown obstacles, moving obstacles, and realistic dynamics are taken into account, the problem becomes NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce advancements to a promising path planning algorithm based on model predictive control (MPC). The algorithm is extended by a method to assign waypoints only to certain agents, a closest waypoint search, and an energy consumption model leading to more realistic trajectories. Since it allows to efficiently use the limited energy, longer missions can be carried out. Additionally, the model enables to initiate the return of agents running low on energy on time and safely return them to the starting location. The proposed strategies are tested in an indoor scenario showing that different rooms can be assigned to individual agents of the swarm and a safe return can be combined with still performing some of the mission objectives.  © 2024 IEEE.","Model Predictive Control; Path Planning; Swarm Navigation","Energy utilization; Model predictive control; Multi agent systems; Predictive control systems; Trajectories; Cooperative path planning; Indoor environment; Model-predictive control; Moving obstacles; Multi agent; Rescue missions; Search and rescue; Swarm navigation; Via modeling; Waypoints; Motion planning","C.

To ensure timely information transmission among all the ground users (GUs) involved in rescue, utilizing fair communication can reduce communication conflicts caused by resource competition and ensure that the GUs can obtain the necessary communication resources to improve rescue efficiency. Therefore, this article investigates the joint optimization of trajectory planning and communication design of multiple UAV base stations (UAV-BSs), as well as the access control of GUs in intelligent collaborative air-ground communication systems. The optimization problem is modeled as a hybrid cooperative competition model, where GUs compete for limited UAV-BS resources to maximize their own long-term throughput, while UAV-BSs collaborate to provide maximum fair throughput for GUs in need. This model belongs to heterogeneous agent collaboration, where the goals of GUs and UAV-BSs are inconsistent, and the UAV-BS has inconsistent goals at different stages with or without GU requests. Therefore, a trajectory planning and communication design algorithm for intelligent collaborative air-ground communication (TPCD-ICAGC) algorithm is designed. By introducing a multihead attention mechanism to quickly determine the target correlation with other agents in a complex state space, so as to improve the adaptability of agents to the model and make more effective decisions. The simulation results show that TPCD-ICAGC outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of the fair communication services of UAV-BSs and the accumulative throughput of GUs. © 2014 IEEE.","air-ground communication; ground user (GU) access control; multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL); UAV trajectory planning; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication design","Access control; Antennas; Base stations; Deep learning; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aerial vehicle; Air/ground communication; Collaboration; Communication design; Ground user  access control; Multi agent; Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; Optimisations; Reinforcement learnings; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle  trajectory planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle communication design; User access control; Vehicle communications; Vehicle trajectories; Trajectories","Q.

A more comprehensive and finer inspection can be realized through the collaborative inspection of UAVs and ground-based intelligent robots. In this paper, we design a system for cooperative inspection of substations by robots and drones, and propose a multi-machine cooperative global path planning based on the improved A∗ algorithm and Bezier curves, which effectively reduces the number of bends and advances smoothly. The search time and the nodes to be selected of the improved A∗ algorithm are significantly shortened compared to both the breadth-first search and the traditional A∗ algorithm, while the number of corners in the same path is reduced from 21 to 5. At the same time, the robot is taken as the main body of path planning, the UAV follows in real time, and a new distributed feedback strategy is designed to control the motion of the point model on the plane, which controls the local relative position to realize the multi-intelligence body consistency formation without using the tree structure by methods such as dynamic feedback linearization. In addition to this, the UAV is also considered to be subject to electromagnetic interference from the substation, which ensures the safety of inspection while inspecting efficiently. © 2024 IEEE.","air-ground collaboration; algorithm; improved A; Substation inspection","Electric substations; Electromagnetic pulse; Feedback linearization; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Machine design; Motion planning; Robot programming; Trees (mathematics); A* algorithm; Air grounds; Air-ground collaboration; Ground based; Improved A; Inspection methods; Multi-machines; Power efficient; Power supply; Substation inspection; Inspection","J.

Initial assessment of a building's health condition often involves identifying these cracks on its surface images. However, capturing these images traditionally relies on human labor, and the small pixel size of cracks in two-dimensional images makes segmentation challenging. In this study, a pioneering approach is introduced for automatic detection of building surface structure damage based on multi-UAV collaboration. The method comprises two primary components. Firstly, we introduce a reconstruction mathematical model based on MVS reconstruction rules to estimate the reconstruction quality. This model guides the extension of multi-UAV trajectories, considering trajectory energy consumption and security, enabling automated image capture and the creation of high-quality 3D models. Secondly, we design a spatial attention mechanism that incorporates Canny edge detection information and improve the deeplabV3 model to realize the automatic recognition of small cracks on building surfaces.

The optimization problem of RUAVs is formulated as minimizing the Bayesian Cramr-Rao lower bound with some practical constraints. To solve this problem, an alternating iterative optimization scheme is presented, in which the coalition formation method is applied for transmit-receive task assignment and the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is devised for path planning. The alternating coalition formation and PSO (ACFPSO) algorithm is, therefore, proposed for RUAVs for target tracking in stand-forward jamming.

However, employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address this challenge introduces computational complexity and convergence obstacles. In response to these challenges, we propose an efficient and robust approach known as spiking reinforcement trajectory planning (SRTP), which uniquely integrates spiking neural networks (SNN) with DRL. SRTP utilizes a Poisson encoding mechanism to seamlessly convert between spike and continuous signals, enabling collaborative learning between spike actor networks and deep critic networks. Additionally, a pseudo-spacetime backpropagation method is employed for accelerated training of the spike actor network. Experimental findings distinctly highlight SRTP's advantages, demonstrating a more streamlined network structure and faster convergence compared to conventional methodologies.

However, to cope with substation inspection scenarios with serious electromagnetic interference, the path nodes planned by the traditional grid method (TGM) are too many and cannot maintain a certain safety distance from obstacles. Therefore, this paper proposes a grid graph modeling method applicable to UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)-intelligent robot cooperative inspection path planning. First, the raster is generated based on the actual substation layout structure, and then the vertices of the obstacle raster are extracted as feature points as new alternative points to plan the path. Then the artificial potential field (APF) method improved by large neighborhood search (LNS) is used to construct the UAV-intelligent robot cooperative inspection path optimization model. The results show that the new raster modeling method can be applied to the path planning of the improved Artificial Potential Field method, and the path can be optimized to make the inspection safer, especially for the operation of the UAV, and can improve the convergence speed of the algorithm, which is better than the traditional raster modeling method in terms of the comprehensive performance. © 2024 IEEE.","Monitoring Mission Points; Path Planning; Transmission Equipment; UAV-Intelligent Robot Collaboration","Antennas; Electric power transmission; Electric substations; Electromagnetic pulse; Graph theory; Inspection; Intelligent robots; Optimization; Robot programming; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Artificial potential fields method; Electromagnetic environments; Model application; Model method; Monitoring mission point; Raster map; Transmission equipments; Unmanned aerial vehicle-intelligent robot collaboration; Voltage levels; Motion planning","H.

In order to effectively utilize multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide fast services and improve resource allocation for air-ground vehicular network, this paper proposes a 3D terrain-oriented path planning algorithm for multi-UAVs assisted intelligent vehicular network based on swarm intelligence optimization. It is aimed to address UAVs&#x0027; air-ground path planning in complex 3D terrains, requiring substantial computation. However, the current multi-objective bald eagle search algorithm tends to approach the center point, resulting in low accuracy when solving such problems. Firstly, the 3D terrain environment model, threat source model, and other models were constructed, and the multi-objective cost function was determined. Secondly, a coupled chaotic map initialization was designed to effectively improve the quality of the initialized population. In addition, an adaptive Gaussian walk strategy based on the &#x201C;reconnaissance eagle&#x201D; was designed to balance development and search capabilities. The fast non-dominated sorting was introduced to further improve the algorithmic efficiency. Finally, we utilized the correlation between the position of the bald eagle and UAV flight parameters of speed, turning angle, and climbing angle. An improved multi-objective bald eagle search (IMBES) was designed to efficiently search for UAV configuration space and find the optimal Pareto front. The experimental results show that the designed IMBES algorithm has a success rate of 70.50&#x0025;. This proposed method offers improved optimization ability, smoother paths, and reduced energy consumption for optimizing collaborative terrain-oriented air-ground path planning, compared with existing path planning methods.

To maximize the GUs' minimum throughput, we propose a collaborative mode switching scheme for the dual-mode UAVs to dynamically switch between the active RF and passive ARIS modes according to the time-varying channel conditions. Besides, we jointly optimize the GUs' transmission control, the UAVs' beamforming, and the trajectory planning strategies. This optimization problem is intractable directly due to the non-convexity in both the objective and constraints. We design an iterative algorithm to first decompose the original problem into several subproblems, and then solve each subproblem individually by approximate optimization methods.

Building upon the foundation of single UAV trajectory planning, the proposed method incorporates collaborative constraints for multi-UAV coordination, forming an evaluation function for multi-UAV collaborative trajectory planning. In order to solve the limitations of the standard Grey Wolf Algorithm, which is prone to local optima and exhibits suboptimal convergence rates, an improved convergence factor strategy and a reward-penalty mechanism in the optimization process are introduced.

Traditional methods are struggling to cope with the increasing task demands. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a more flexible and efficient solution for path planning through offline training and online reasoning, which is expected to better adapt to the complexity of urban environments. Thus, a multi-UAV path planning method based on improved Dueling Double DQN (D3QN) and graph augmentation techniques is proposed in this paper, which effectively addresses the collaborative path planning problem in multi-UAV systems by combining DRL and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). In the proposed method, the D3QN algorithm is adopted to enhance the interaction between UAVs and the environment using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) communication model based on historical trajectory information. Furthermore, a task-driven dynamic priority adjustment mechanism is proposed to balance the relationship between UAV paths and energy consumption. Meanwhile, a dynamic incentive adjustment mechanism combining complex real-time environment information and UAV states is proposed to enhance the performance and adaptability of the path planning algorithm. Simulation experiments were conducted to validate the algorithm and compare it with the general DRL methods such as DQN and D3QN, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Dueling double DQN algorithm; Graph augmentation; Multi-UAVs; Path planning; Task-driven method","Aircraft communication; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Graph algorithms; Motion planning; Network theory (graphs); Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Urban planning; Adjustment mechanisms; Aerial vehicle; Complex urban environments; Cooperative path planning; Dueling double D3QN algorithm; Graph augmentation; Multi UAV; Task-driven; Task-driven method; Urban environments; Graph neural networks","J.

Equipped with both communication modules and sensing modules, UAVs are capable of conducting integrated communication and target detection, thus greatly improving spectrum efficiency and system performance. In this article, we consider a scenario where multiple UAVs collaborate to detect targets and transmit the collected data to a central UAV. Addressing the problem of communication and perception scheduling, we first analyze the target detection and communication performance, and then formulate the joint communication and perception scheduling problem as two optimization problems, with the objectives being maximizing the average utility function (MAUF) and minimizing the completion time (MCT), respectively. To solve the formulated problems, we first consider the dynamic characteristics of the environment, and model the problems as two Markov decision processes. Regarding the UAVs as multiple agents, we then propose a multiagent double deep Q-network (DDQN)-based MAUF algorithm and a multiagent DDQN-based MCT algorithm to determine the communication and perception scheduling strategies of the UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms.  © 2024 IEEE.","Collaborative sensing; integrated sensing and communication (ISAC); multiagent reinforcement learning; trajectory planning; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Aircraft communication; Aircraft detection; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling algorithms; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Average utilities; Collaborative sensing; Integrated sensing; Integrated sensing and communication; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Targets detection; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Utility functions; Markov processes","R.

To optimize flight performance during swarm rendezvous, this paper proposes a trajectory planning method that enables members harvest wind energy. Integrate wind energy harvesting strategies for single vehicles with the spatial-temporal coordination of the swarm system. This strategy efficiently manages wind, mechanical, and electrical energies, thereby extending their endurance and range. This method is formulated using the Optimal Control Problem (OCP) framework, considering the dynamics of the swarm system. To ensure control input continuity and trajectory feasibility, the method incorporates constraints on thrust and its increment, which reduces the number of collocation points and lessens computational burden when the OCP is converted into a Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problem for solving. The optimal trajectory of a single UAV is employed as the initial guess to accelerate convergence and enhance solution global optimality. The trajectory planning results demonstrate that, to achieve mechanical energy consistency during the rendezvous process, members with differing initial potential energies after air-launch employ independent wind energy harvesting strategies to compensate for trajectory energy costs. This method optimally plans collaborative trajectories for multiple vehicles within spatiotemporal constraints, significantly broadening their reachable domain. The comprehensive management of energy reserves from air-launched vehicles, including potential and electrical energy, along with the harvesting of wind energy, can significantly extend the range and endurance of air-launched swarm missions. © 2013 IEEE.","energy consumption; optimal control; Swarm robots; trajectory planning; UAV; wind energy","Flight paths; Global optimization; Health risks; Motion planning; Optimal control systems; Robot programming; Space rendezvous; Aerial vehicle; Energy; Energy-consumption; Harvesting strategy; Optimal controls; Swarm robots; Swarm systems; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Wind energy harvesting; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","L.

Drone Automated Shepherding leverages advanced maneuverability and an extensive field of view to improve the efficiency of these tasks, which are typically labor-intensive and time-consuming. Existing methods for managing large herds face significant challenges due to insufficient coordination among multiple drones and the complexities involved in simultaneously executing diverse shepherding tasks. This paper aims to enhance the execution of multiple shepherding tasks by optimizing drone coordination, designing optimal flight paths, and reducing flight time. To harness the potential of reinforcement learning, we develop a multi-drone collaborative shepherding environment that facilitates efficient drone training using a dense reward system. Additionally, we employ a multi-task deep reinforcement learning algorithm that enhances the sample efficiency and reward performance by leveraging shared information across tasks within this environment. Two specific tasks, driving and collecting, are used to assess the performance of our methodology. The effectiveness of our approach is measured against a classical solution named CTRL, examining metrics such as success rate, completion time, and flight path length. Results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms the CTRL in all measured metrics. Visualization of drone trajectories provides further evidence of our enhanced collaboration and efficiency in shepherding operations. Real-world experiments are conducted on a square of 300 m3, where two drones utilize our method to guide four small autonomous vehicles from the starting area to the goal area within 30 seconds.  © 2024 IEEE.","collaboration; Path planning for multiple mobile robots or agents; reinforcement learning; shepherding","Chatbots; Collaborative robots; Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Maneuverability; Mobile robots; Motion planning; Multi-task learning; Reinforcement learning; Robot learning; Robot programming; Animal husbandry; Collaboration; Crowd managements; Multi tasks; Multiple mobile agents; Multiple mobile robot; Path planning for multiple mobile robot or agent; Performance; Reinforcement learnings; Shepherding; Drones","B.

Due to the complex and changeable scene and environment of UAV mission execution, it is very important to select an appropriate UAV path planning algorithm. This paper aims at the path planning problem of multiple UAVs in a complex three-dimensional environment to ensure that multiple UAVs reach the mission location from different angles. Taking the chaotic genetic algorithm in network security protection as the main body, the operation difficulty of the algorithm is reduced, and the solution speed and accuracy of the algorithm are improved. The path length obtained by the proposed algorithm is 8.4% less than that of the ABC algorithm, 11.3% less than that of the PSO algorithm, and 4.2% less than that of the BABC algorithm. The system running time of the improved algorithm is also reduced by 27% to 45% compared with other algorithms. In terms of unmanned cooperation, this paper proposes a system capability based on network modeling to improve the cooperative combat capability of multiple UAVs. By establishing a network model, information sharing, collaborative decision-making and collaborative decision-making between drones are realized, thereby improving the effectiveness of the entire system.

This paper studies the formation rendezvous problem of gliding vehicles. A Dubins curve based hierarchical planning method is proposed, including rendezvous points assignment, cooperative path generation and path following control. The initial paths are generated according to the terminal space constraint, and the minimal turning radius is selected based on the acceleration constraint. To satisfy simultaneous arrival constraint, we improve the estimation of arrival time for path following based on the gliding model and path parameters. Taking the maximum estimated arrival time as reference, the paths are elongated by turning radius adjustment. To handle the time estimation bias in long-distance flight, online planning is adopted based on the current vehicle states.

However, in response to the complex substation scenarios with uneven distribution, the traditional path planning methods do not consider the influence of the spatial height of obstacles, and lack a collaborative inspection strategy to optimize the cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-dimensional path planning method based on the improved Firefly Optimization Algorithm (GSO) UAV-intelligent vehicle cooperative power inspection. Firstly, based on the actual substation layout structure, the vertices of the obstacle grid were collected as feature points to generate a three-dimensional grid model, which narrowed the search range of the path planning algorithm. Secondly, the GSO algorithm is used to construct a three-dimensional path optimization model of UAV-AGV, and based on the mixed integer linear programming model, a multi-objective optimization function considering the inspection time and cost of UAV endurance is established to construct constraints for path collaboration. Finally, the simulation results of the inspection task show that the proposed method can be well adapted to the 3D grid scene, and its time cost and total energy cost are optimized by 4.9% and 6.4%, respectively, compared with the ant colony algorithm. © 2024 SPIE.","Automated Guided Vehicle; Cooperative inspection; Firefly Algorithm; Three-dimensional path planning; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Ant colony optimization; Antennas; Electric power distribution; Electric substations; Inspection; Integer programming; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Multiobjective optimization; Robot programming; Three dimensional computer graphics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Automated guided vehicles; Cooperative inspection; Electric power; Firefly algorithms; Operations and maintenance; Path planning method; Power; Three-dimensional path planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Motion planning","M.

Traditional algorithms have challenging issues of high computational complexity and low efficiency in UAV swarm networking and collaboration, while computational intelligence (CI) has attracted increasing attention since it has advantages in solving complex optimization problems. The networking of UAV swarms serves as an essential foundation for collaboration, and intelligent collaboration is a crucial means of enhancing the performance of UAV swarm systems. To date, extensive CI-based algorithms have been proposed to improve the networking and collaboration capabilities of UAV swarms, and several relevant surveys have also been presented. However, existing surveys either review networking or collaboration. To the best of our knowledge, there is no survey that simultaneously concentrates on CI-based UAV swarm networking and collaboration. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of CI-based networking and collaboration algorithms from six typical aspects including channel access, network routing, cooperative task assignment, cooperative path planning, cooperative search, and cooperative jamming. More importantly, to help researchers choose appropriate algorithms to satisfy the requirements of different missions, we classify CI-based algorithms into four categories, namely heuristic behavior search-based algorithms, policy design-based algorithms, policy learning-based algorithms, and hybrid algorithms. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions that may influence future research on UAV swarm intelligence networking and collaboration. This review may provide new insights and valuable references for researchers in this field. © 2024 IEEE.","collaboration; computational intelligence; heuristic behavior search-based algorithms; hybrid algorithms; networking; policy design-based algorithms; policy learning-based algorithms; UAV swarms","Antennas; Autonomous vehicles; Complex networks; Computational efficiency; Learning algorithms; Military applications; Military vehicles; Motion planning; Swarm intelligence; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Classification algorithm; Collaboration; Heuristic behavior search-based algorithm; Heuristics algorithm; Hybrid algorithms; Learning-based algorithms; Networking; Policy design; Policy design-based algorithm; Policy learning; Policy learning-based algorithm; Search-based algorithms; Task analysis; Tutorial; Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm; Heuristic algorithms","L.

To collect data efficiently, AUVs traverse the overlapping communication region of sensor nodes instead of accessing every sensor node. In addition, the sensing function is required to enable obstacle avoidance. To this end, we first propose the time division multiple access (TDMA)-based communication and mono-static sensing strategy for ISAC-UANs. Secondly, we formulate the data collection and trajectory design problem into a min-max problem to minimize energy consumption and enhance the network throughput. To solve this problem, we decouple it into three sub-problems: the sensor node clustering problem, the cluster traversal problem, and the trajectory planning problem. The first sub-problem is to determine the AUV traversal area to collect data, which is solved by an overlapping communication regions based clustering algorithm. The second sub-problem is to determine the AUVs' cluster traversal sequence minimizing the traversal length, which is solved by an min-max ant colony optimization (ACO)-based algorithm. The third sub-problem involves planning the optimal trajectory for AUVs to reach the data collection area while avoiding obstacles, which is solved by the soft actor-critic (SAC)-based online trajectory planning algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms benchmarks in terms of trajectory length, energy consumption, and network throughput. © 2024 IEEE.","","Autonomous underwater vehicles; Benchmarking; Motion planning; Sensor nodes; Steganography; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Autonomous underwater vehicles]; Collaborative data collection; Data collection; Data trajectories; Energy-consumption; Integrated sensing; Network throughput; Sub-problems; Trajectory Planning; Underwater acoustic networks; Ant colony optimization","L.

Accordingly, a novel multi-UAV adaptive cooperative formation trajectory planning approach is proposed in this article based on an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm in unknown obstacle environments, which innovatively introduces long short-Term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) into the environment perception end of multi-Agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) network, and develops an improved potential field-based dense reward function to strengthen the policy learning efficiency and accelerates the convergence respectively. Moreover, a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning training mechanism, including adaptive formation layer, trajectory planning layer and action execution layer is implemented to explore an optimal trajectory planning policy. Additionally, an adaptive formation maintaining and transformation strategy is presented for UAV swarm to comply with the environment with narrow passages. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is better in policy learning efficiency, optimality of trajectory planning policy and adaptability to narrow passages than that using multi-Agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) and MATD3.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","adaptive formation strategy; deep reinforcement learning; hierarchical training mechanism; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) cooperative formation trajectory planning; potential field-based dense reward","Antennas; Brain; Efficiency; Learning algorithms; Long short-term memory; Multi agent systems; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Adaptive formation strategy; Deep reinforcement learning; Hierarchical training mechanism; Hierarchical trainings; Multi UAV; Multi-UAV cooperative formation trajectory planning; Potential field; Potential field-based dense reward; Reinforcement learnings; Trajectory Planning; Trajectories","B.

These systems are characterized by their decentralization, scalability, robustness, and the local perspectives of individual agents. In the realm of quadrotor applications, MAS can perform complex tasks such as formation flying, surveillance, search and rescue, and cooperative payload transport. The control of such systems often involves techniques like trajectory planning, consensus algorithms, formation control, and obstacle avoidance. This study introduces a multi-agent quadrotor system controlled using sliding mode backstepping control (SMBC), which combines the advantages of backstepping and sliding mode control to ensure stability and robustness. The novel aspect of this research is the transformation of the leader quadrotor into a fractional-order system (FOS) while maintaining the followers as integer-order systems, all controlled using the same SMBC method. MATLAB simulations validate that the fractional-order leader (FOL) achieves superior trajectory tracking compared to the integer-order leader. Furthermore, the followers tracking the fractional-order leader exhibit enhanced performance, with reduced tracking errors and quicker response times. These findings demonstrate the potential advantages of incorporating fractional-order dynamics into multi-agent control systems. ©2024 The Authors.","fractional-order control; Multi-agent systems; quadrotor dynamics; robust control strategies; sliding mode backstepping control; trajectory tracking","Air navigation; Backstepping; Robust control; Robustness (control systems); Sliding mode control; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Backstepping control; Control strategies; Fractional order control; Multiagent systems (MASs); Quad rotors; Quadrotor dynamic; Robust control strategy; Sliding mode backstepping control; Sliding modes; Trajectory-tracking; MATLAB","S.

To solve issues, such as low material distribution efficiency and poor mobility during disaster rescue, we propose a two-layer optimization mechanism-based multiple UAV dynamic task planning method (DAWN), which can cope with the problem of the global communication link unreachable caused by disasters. Specifically, we consider the global task allocation as a dynamic vehicle routing problem (VRP) and use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve it so as to minimize the global flight path and energy consumption. Second, based on the current communication structure, we establish a local path planning approach based on the trust network that maximizes the regional coverage rate while minimizing the flight paths. On the basis of these two layers, an UAV formation dynamic task planning approach is realized. Experimental results prove that the proposed DAWN can obtain the optimal flight paths and achieve higher energy efficiency while providing reasonable region coverage to discover more potential tasks. © 2014 IEEE.","Dynamic task planning; global task allocation; local path planning; multiple UAVs; trust network","Deep learning; Disasters; Dynamics; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Flight paths; Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Vehicle routing; Dynamic task planning; Dynamic tasks; Global task allocation; Local path-planning; Multiple UAVs; Optimisations; Task allocation; Task planning; Trust networks; Two-layer; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","W.

While improved coverage efficiency can be achieved with the use of multiple cooperative agents, the problem of determining the optimal joint action can be an exponentially complex optimization problem. Such complexity lends itself to a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach. Previous approaches, however, often train to specific, known, static environments; generating policies that do not port well to previously unseen and dynamic environments. Here we present an approach to the MARL coverage path problem which allows for a single policy to be applied to environments with varying numbers of disjoint, nonconvex areas of interest, to which the agents may have never been exposed and which may be changing. We do this while considering other priorities such as hazards to the agents and battery life. We correct for any policy suboptimalities inherent in almost any machine learning approach by performing the equivalent of a Newton step using Monte Carlo tree search to perform an online multi-step lookahead prior to policy rollout. We validate our approach by showing our early results match those generated using mixed integer programming. While our path-planning approach is vehicle agnostic, we validate the dynamic feasibility of the resulting paths using unmanned aerial vehicles flying within a motion capture space. Our quadrotors autonomously and aggressively fly complex coverage patterns collision-free within 60 cm of each other and at speeds over 6 m/s, demonstrating the capacity of our approach to provide time and safety-critical multiagent coverage in a wide variety of circumstances. © 2024 by Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","","Antennas; Collision avoidance; Efficiency; Fertilizers; Hazards; Integer programming; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Cooperative agents; Coverage efficiencies; Coverage path planning; Dynamic environments; Hazardous environment; Joint actions; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Path problems; Search and rescue; Unknown environments; Motion planning","","","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA","","978-162410711-5","","","English","AIAA SciTech Forum Expos.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195595541"

With the recent development of drone networks, researchers have also applied MARL to address the trajectory planning problems. However, the dynamic environment and the limited battery capacity are still challenging for using MARL to achieve efficient collaborative task execution. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware MARL model as an attempt to tackle these challenges, leveraging Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with individual reward functions driven by the task execution progress and the remaining battery of drones. We conduct a set of simulation studies for the proposed mode and compare it with the shared reward MARL Li2022MARL to explore the impact of credit assignment in MARL. The results indicate that our proposed model can achieve at least 80% success rate regardless of the task locations and lengths. Similar to the shared reward mode, the individual reward mode can achieve a better success rate when the task density is high, and it can hit nearly a 100% success rate when task density gets close to 40%. The true advantage of our proposed model with individual reward is revealed when scaling up the environment. The comparison to the shared reward MARL shows that the our proposed model is more robust towards the change of the environment size and agent numbers. It can achieve higher success rate with fewer steps due to the clarity of the goal which improves energy efficiency even better.  © 2014 IEEE.","collaborative execution; deep Q-network; drone networks; mission-oriented; multi-agent reinforcement learning","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Drones; Federated learning; Lithium batteries; Reinforcement learning; Autonomous driving; Collaborative execution; Collaborative systems; Deep Q-network; Drone network; Energy aware; Mission-oriented; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Scaling-up; Task executions; Deep reinforcement learning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","23274662","","","","English","IEEE Internet Things J.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211196215"

This emerging trend aims to optimize the flight routes of UAVs in order to minimize their energy usage. Path planning is a key process to determine the trajectory of a UAV from its origin to its destination. However, many algorithms proposed for this task have proven to be inefficient in complex obstacle environments. For this reason, this paper proposes a Levy flight based multi-population gray wolf optimization (LM-GWO) algorithm. It combines multi-population ideas, and clusters individual gray wolves into different populations through the Bi-Kmeans clustering algorithm. It accelerates the algorithm's convergence by allowing different gray wolf populations to complete different jobs during the training process. In addition, one of the limitations of the GWO algorithm is its susceptibility to getting trapped in local optima, which is solved by introducing the Levy flight mechanism, which ultimately makes the multi-UAVs cooperate to complete the path planning work. The results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the LM-GWO algorithm can get the flight path that satisfies the constraints. By comparing with the other three algorithms, the algorithm's effectiveness in solving cooperative path planning to save energy consumption is verified. © 2024 IEEE.","bi-kmeans; grey wolf optimization; levy fight; path planning; unmanned aerial vehicle","Flight simulators; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Bi-kmean; Gray wolf optimization; Gray wolves; K-means; Levy fight; Levy flights; Multi population; Optimisations; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Energy efficiency","L.

This paper focuses on studying the coverage path planning problem under multi-UAV collaboration to maximize the coverage of the mission area within a given time. To address this problem, we propose a multi-objective optimization model and reformulate it with the framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP). We then employ a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method to solve the problem. Specifically, we introduce the ε−Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (ε−MADT3), which incorporates an exploration coefficient based on MATD3. This coefficient gradually decays with the number of iterations, allowing for a balance between exploration and exploitation. Numerous simulation results demonstrate that ε−MADT3 outperforms the baseline algorithm in terms of coverage rate and number of collisions. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology provides an emerging solution to this problem. This paper designs a UAV-assisted underwater IoT data collection system architecture. In this architecture, UAVs collect data through relay cooperation, effectively reducing the flight time for remote UAVs to return to the seashore base station (SBS). We propose a hybrid collaborative data collection scheme (HCDC) to generate a collection strategy for UAVs. In this scheme, we first allocate a balanced workload to the UAVs and determine the initial traversal order for each UAV to collect data from various surface sink nodes (SSNs). Then we introduce a relay matching algorithm to establish the relay relationships among UAVs. Finally, we present a trajectory planning algorithm based on hierarchical multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed HCDC scheme significantly reduces both the flight time and data collection time of the UAVs, thereby minimizing the age of information (AoI). Moreover, compared to other data collection schemes, HCDC performs better in networks of various scales.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Age of information (AoI); Data collection; Underwater Internet of Things; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned underwater vehicles; Aerial vehicle; Age of information; Collaborative data collection; Data collection; Data collection scheme; Flight time; Oceanic environments; Reinforcement learnings; Underwater internet of thing; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1530437X","","","","English","IEEE Sensors J.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209552602"

However, IoT devices in isolated locations have insufficient energy storage as well as computing resources and may fall outside the service range of ground communication networks. To overcome the constraints of communication coverage and terminal resource, this paper proposes a multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted air-ground collaborative edge computing network model, which comprises associated UAVs, auxiliary UAVs, ground user devices (GDs), and base stations (BSs), intending to minimize the overall system energy consumption. It delves into task offloading, UAV trajectory planning and edge resource allocation, which thus is classified as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. Worse still, the coupling of long-term task queuing delay and short-term offloading decision makes it challenging to address the original issue directly. Therefore, we employ Lyapunov optimization to transform it into two sub-problems. The first involves task offloading for GDs, trajectory optimization for associated UAVs as well as auxiliary UAVs, which is tackled using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), while the second deals with task partitioning and computing resource allocation, which we address via convex optimization. Through numerical simulations, we verify that the proposed approach outperforms other benchmark methods regarding overall system energy consumption.  © 2024 IEEE.","Lyapunov optimization; Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (MADDPG); Multi-UAV collaborative air-ground edge computing; resource allocation; trajectory optimization","Aircraft communication; Benchmarking; Computation offloading; Deep reinforcement learning; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Queueing theory; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Air grounds; Deterministics; Edge computing; Lyapunov optimization; Multi agent; Multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle collaborative air-ground edge computing; Optimisations; Policy gradient; Resources allocation; Trajectory optimization; Convex optimization","P.

However, the quality of communication among UAVs cannot be guaranteed in dynamic environments, which hinders real-time information exchange among UAVs within the UAV cluster and results in poor cluster performance. In order to solve this problem, a joint task assignment and trajectory planning problem is studied under the practically limited communication among UAVs while avoiding collisions. It is a complex combinatorial optimization problem and challenging to solve.

Considering flight performance constraints, communication capabilities and mission constraints, the online trajectory planning problem is transformed into an optimal control problem, and an online trajectory planning algorithm for multiple UAVs is given. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the target positioning results obtained by using the online trajectory planning method given in this paper is higher than that of the pre-planned flight trajectory, which verifies the effectiveness of the method given in this paper. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Online route planning; Optimal control; Positioning accuracy analysis; Target collaborative positioning","Flight simulators; Motion planning; Optimal control systems; Trajectories; Collaborative localizations; Online route planning; Online trajectory planning; Optimal controls; Positioning accuracy; Positioning accuracy analysis; Route planning; Target collaborative positioning; Target positioning; Trajectory planning method; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","D.

It generally focuses on coverage completion with less robot (mostly drone) occupation and higher time efficiency. However, as the map becomes larger, most existing works will fail to remain near-optimal due to escalating complexity. In this paper, we formulate the problem as two levels of traveling salesman problem (TSP) to reduce the complexity, where the lower level is single-robot local coverage planning with preset TSP solutions, and the higher level is multiple TSP (mTSP) global planning executed by multiple robots. To better adapt to dynamic scenarios, we apply a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that allows efficient online computation, and a dense segmented Siamese network (DSSN) to achieve efficient and effective solutions. We show that compared to existing advanced methods, our strategy can effectively solve the problem with coverage costs decreased by over 30% average and the execution time reduced to seconds in large maps. Furthermore, our network DSSN achieves an additional improvement with random settings to the previous mTSP architecture. We also discuss the influence of different robot densities and separated block sizes on the results, and demonstrate the adaptability to irregular and large-scale obstacles. © 2016 IEEE.","complete coverage; large maps; Path planning for multiple mobile robots or agents; planning; reinforcement learning; scheduling and coordination","Adversarial machine learning; Chatbots; Collaborative robots; Fire extinguishers; Fireproofing; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Microrobots; Mobile robots; Motion planning; Multi agent systems; Multipurpose robots; Nanorobots; Reinforcement learning; Robot learning; Robot programming; Complete coverages; Large maps; Multiple mobile agents; Multiple mobile robot; Multiple-robots; Path planning for multiple mobile robot or agent; Reinforcement learnings; Salesman problem; Scheduling and coordinations; Travelling salesman; Traveling salesman problem","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","23773766","","","","English","IEEE Robot.

Due to limited onboard storage and expensive hardware costs, reducing both the energy consumption and the number of UAVs is critical for these multi-UAV applications. However, existing studies primarily revolved around energy minimization in two-dimensional (2-D) scenarios, given a sufficient but fixed number of UAVs, and most of them considered specific application scenarios, resulting in poor generality. In contrast, this paper defines a generalized application scenario, in which multiple ground nodes (GNs) are accessed by multiple UAVs in three-dimensional (3-D) scenarios, and aims to minimize the energy consumption by employing the necessary (or equivalently minimum) number of UAVs and formulating a mix-integer nonconvex problem. To this end, this paper decomposes the problem into two subproblems: energy consumption minimization for a single UAV consecutively accessing any two GNs and energy-efficient multi-UAV GN-accessing path planning employing the minimum number of UAVs. The first subproblem is solved by applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and the path discretization method, while the second subproblem is addressed by designing a three-stage approximation framework based on modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and greedy path assignment (GPA). Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of optimality and efficiency compared to several other counterparts. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","energy consumption; GN-accessing; GPA; MPSO; Multiple UAVs; number of UAVs","Antennas; Digital storage; Discrete event simulation; Energy efficiency; Job analysis; Motion planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Energy-consumption; Greedy path assignment; Ground node; Ground node-accessing; Minimisation; Modified particle swarm optimization; Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle; Number of unmanned aerial vehicle; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Swarm optimization; Task analysis; Energy utilization","B.

In actual specific scenes, there are often many complex constraints, besides the most basic kinematic constraints, there are also task constraints, such as the need to continuously irradiate suspicious targets on the way to the end area as much as possible. However, according to the pre-investigation, most of the related task constraints consider the cooperation between airspace and time domain, and seldom consider the task constraints with non-cooperative targets in trajectory planning, and the solved trajectory is difficult to execute directly. To meet this requirement, a trajectory planning algorithm under complex constraint A* is proposed. The trajectory planning satisfies the constraints of minimum turning radius starting point and ending point. Then the trajectory is solved by using bounded search method within the set boundary. According to the analysis of simulation results, the trajectory solved by the proposed algorithm meets the requirements of UAV steering motion, and maximizes its task completion within bounded constraints.

Given the unique characteristics of large-scale environments, such as minimal terrain restrictions, vast monitoring scope, and a potentially high number of monitoring points, it becomes inherently difficult to effectively manage and optimize UAV operations over the large coverage are and the potential for a high number of target points. In response to this challenge, we propose an innovative UAV path planning strategy that capitalizes on the strengths of both evolutionary computing and clustering algorithms. As a first step, we propose an advanced version of the k-means algorithm to cluster multiple target points along the drone patrol route. This approach not only facilitates division of the extensive target area into manageable sections, but also aims to equalize the patrol distances for each UAV. This effort optimizes load balancing and boosts overall operational efficiency. Next, we implement a customized genetic algorithm to formulate an optimized path planning scheme for the UAVs, with a specific focus on the clustered sub-target points as derived from the k-means algorithm. The primary objective of our proposed scheme is to further minimize the differences in cruise path lengths among individual UAVs, thereby achieving load balancing and enhancing overall system efficiency.

A moving horizon estimator (MHE) is used to estimate the vehicle states with the help of relative bearing information to known landmarks and other vehicles. The goal of the NMPC is to devise optimal paths for each vehicle between a given source and destination while maintaining desired localization accuracy. Estimating localization covariance in the NMPC is computationally intensive; hence, we develop an approximate analytical closed-form expression based on the relationship between covariance and path lengths to landmarks. Using this expression while computing NMPC commands reduces the computational complexity significantly. We present numerical simulations to validate the proposed approach for different numbers of vehicles and landmark configurations. We also compare the results with EKF and RRT based methods to show the superiority of the proposed closed-form approach.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.","cooperative localization; nonlinear model predictive control; Path planning; UAVs","Antennas; Model predictive control; Nonlinear equations; Nonlinear systems; Predictive control systems; Uncertainty analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cooperative localization; Cooperative path planning; Localisation; Location awareness; Moving horizon estimator; Nonlinear model predictive control; Path planning problems; Predictive control; Uncertainty; Vehicle state; Motion planning","S.

Multi-UAV MEC systems can meet the quality of service requirements for computation intensive applications of ground terminals (GTs) in complex field environments, emergency disaster relief and other special scenarios. In this paper, a multi-UAV cooperative computation framework is proposed while taking the GT movement and random arrival of computation tasks into consideration. A long-term optimization problem is formulated for the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and resource allocation, subject to minimizing the total GT computation task completion time and the total system energy consumption. To solve this problem, a joint multiple time-scale optimization algorithm is proposed. In particular, the optimization problem is decomposed into a long time-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning subproblem and a short time-scale resource allocation subproblem. The proximal policy optimization algorithm is invoked to solve the long time-scale subproblem. The greedy algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method are employed to solve the short time-scale subproblem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can quickly adapt to different degrees of environmental dynamics and outperforms the benchmark algorithm for different task requirements and available resources. © 2024 IEEE.","deep reinforcement learning; mobile edge computing; multi-UAV cooperative computation; resource allocation; trajectory planning","Aircraft accidents; Benchmarking; Convex optimization; Deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Risk perception; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Computing system; Cooperative computation; Edge computing; Ground terminals; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative computation; Reinforcement learnings; Resources allocation; Sub-problems; Trajectory Planning; Mobile edge computing","W.

However, existing path planning methodologies often overlook strict security measures, resulting in sensitive information, from both civilian and even military use scenarios, vulnerable to security attacks. Moreover, the involvement of multiple parties, each with its own set of sensitive information, raises concerns regarding data privacy and security. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel approach that employs Multi-Party Secure Computation (SMPC) techniques atop generic path planning algorithms to address these security and privacy challenges. We propose SecuPath, a secure framework that leverages cryptographic protocols for secure communication and computation, enabling multiple entities to jointly compute optimal drone paths without revealing their private inputs to any party. By integrating this privacy-preserving layer onto generic drone path planning algorithms, we ensure the optimality of the planning process while significantly elevating the privacy and security standards of UAV path planning operations. This framework not only preserves the confidentiality and privacy of sensitive data, but also fosters collaboration in scenarios where data sharing is essential, such as in urban airspace management or disaster response. Moreover, we analyse the communication and computation overhead introduced by the SMPC and demonstrate the protocol remains practical and efficient. This research contributes to the growing field of work addressing privacy concerns in drone applications and provides a foundation for the development of secure and collaborative UAV systems. The integration of SMPC techniques with generic drone path planning algorithms sets the groundwork for privacy-preserving drone operations with wide applications across diverse domains with a balance between robust security measures and operational feasibility. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Generic Algorithm; Privacy Preserving; Secure Multi-Party Computation; UAV Path Planning","Antennas; Computational efficiency; Computer programming; Drones; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Aerial vehicle; Generic algorithm; Path-planning algorithm; Planning framework; Privacy preserving; Secure multi-party computation; Security measure; Sensitive informations; Unmanned aerial vehicle path planning; Vehicle path planning; Motion planning","Y.

The problem involves the influence of target movement and environmental obstacles on the update of the UAV's local target probability map (TPM), as well as communication information corruption among UAVs due to packet loss and resulting local information inconsistency. The objective is to efficiently plan paths for the UAV swarm to discover more targets. To address the above issues, this paper proposes the following methods. Firstly, an information diffusion model is introduced to simulate the TPM changes caused by target movement and the discovery of obstacles based on a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution, thereby correcting the real-time target information held by UAVs. Secondly, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is employed to recover the corrupted information, and a weighted averaging method is used to fuse the information from multiple UAVs, achieving consensus among the UAVs. Lastly, the original gray wolf optimizer (GWO) is enhanced by incorporating strategies such as Levy flight and the nonlinear convergence factor. Subsequently, the improved GWO is integrated with the model predictive control (MPC) for UAV trajectory planning, enabling a more efficient search for optimal paths. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed information recovery method outperforms the compared methods by 24.7% in terms of performance. The proposed comprehensive search approach shows higher efficiency in searching for more targets within a specified time, and it also exhibits advantages in terms of area coverage and other aspects. © 2024 Jiaqi Zhan et al.","","Aircraft communication; Aircraft exhibitions; Gaussian distribution; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Condition; Cooperative search; Gray wolves; Moving targets; Optimizers; Packets loss; Probability maps; Target movements; Target search; Radial basis function networks","C.

Benefiting from its fast and flexible deployment capabilities, UAV swarms have been widely applied to emergency communications. In the event of damaged ground communication base stations, UAV swarms can quickly reconstruct an emer-gency communication network. However, considering the limited coverage power of a single UAV node, it underscores the need for effective coordination among swarm units as well as diligent planning of a coverage trajectory. In this paper, we propose a cooperative intelligence-based UAV swarm approach for establishing emergency communications. We model a multi-UAV base station-assisted emergency communication scenario as a team Markov game model.

Task allocation is facilitated by assigning optimal inspection volumes to each team, following best-first rules. A voxel map-based representation of the environment is used for pathfinding, and a rule-based path-planning method is the core of this approach.

However, searching underwater areas remains a challenge for UAVs. For antisubmarine search tasks, this article proposes using a mixed swarm of UAVs and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). To generate vehicle paths with the goal of minimizing the travel time while achieving complete coverage, a two-phase strategy is developed. In the first phase, optimal waypoints are determined to balance the task volume among the UAVs and USVs. A mapping model is constructed to represent the relationships between the different unmanned platforms and the mission environment. In the second phase, the search trajectory for each UAV/USV is generated by combining waypoint clustering and closed-loop trajectory generation. A detailed simulation study confirms the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed path planning method when applied to cross-domain swarms of different types and sizes for antisubmarine missions. In addition, the simulation results show that cross-domain cooperative planning for unmanned platforms may have advantages over single-domain planning in some scenarios.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Antisubmarine search; cooperative path planning; deconvolution technique; improved genetic algorithm (GA); unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned surface vehicles (USV)","Air navigation; Antennas; Genetic algorithms; Submarines; Travel time; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned surface vehicles; Aerial vehicle; Anti-submarine search; Anti-submarines; Cooperative path planning; Deconvolution techniques; Improved genetic algorithm; Search problem; Task analysis; Underwater vehicles; Unmanned aerial vehicle&unmanned surface vehicle; Motion planning","X.

However, due to the lack of base stations (BSs), how to complete rescue while maintaining communication between vehicles is an unresolved challenge. In this paper, we design an efficient and fault-tolerant communication solution by jointly optimizing vehicles' trajectory, offloading scheduling, and routing topology for a heterogeneous vehicle system. First, we model several essential factors in maritime SAR, including the impact of ocean currents, the observational behavior of UAVs, the fault tolerance of relay networks, resource management of mobile edge computing (MEC), and energy consumption. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated, aiming at minimizing time and energy consumption while increasing the fault tolerance of relay networks. Then, we transfer the objective into a decentralized partially observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) and introduce multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to search for a collaborative strategy. Specifically, two MARL approaches with different training styles are evaluated, and three techniques are added for improving performance, including sharing parameters, normalized generalized-advantage-estimation (GAE), and preserving-outputs-precisely-while-adaptively-rescaling-targets (Pop-Art). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach, named heterogeneous vehicles multi-agent proximal policy optimization (HVMAPPO), outperforms other baselines in efficiency and fault tolerance of communication. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","automatic surface vehicle (ASV); efficiency; fault-tolerant communication; Maritime search and rescue (SAR); multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL); unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Autonomous underwater vehicles; Autonomous vehicles; Cooperative communication; Energy utilization; Markov processes; Mobile edge computing; Motion planning; Multi agent systems; Multiobjective optimization; Reinforcement learning; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aerial vehicle; Automatic surface vehicle; Fault tolerant communications; Fault- tolerant systems; Maritime search and rescue; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Optimisations; Search and rescue; Surface vehicles; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Fault tolerance","Y.

The typical scene of multi-UAV task allocation is described, and a heterogeneous multi-UAV multi-constraint model is established via multigroup settings. According to this framework, the environmental stimulus and response thresholds of the dynamic ant colony division of labor model are redesigned, the coupling between task allocation and path planning is considered, and the RRT* algorithm is used to complete path cost estimation, which makes the task allocation result more reasonable in environments containing obstacles. Considering cases involving UAV faults, this study proposes different fault handling strategies to distinguish different fault types and better fit the actual situation of UAV missions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can quickly and effectively solve the task allocation problem of multiple UAVs in a dynamic environment. © 2024 SPIE.","Assignment of tasks; Drones; Dynamic ant colony division model; Emergencies; Troubleshooting","Ant colony optimization; Drones; Manned space flight; Problem solving; Time difference of arrival; Aerial vehicle; Ant colonies; Ant colony's labor divisions; Assignment of task; Cooperative tasks; Dynamic ant colony division model; Emergency; Multi-constraints; Task allocation; Vehicle mission; Motion planning","T.

The swarm intelligence optimization algorithms have achieved good results in solving the shortest path NP problem. Recently, a Dynamic Group-based Collaborative Optimization (DGBCO) has shown good performance in the field of UAV path planning, but there are also several shortcomings, such as insufficient exploration space during the exploration phase and lacking information exchange between the exploitation and exploration groups. Inspired by these, we proposed an Enhanced Dynamic Group-based Collaborative Optimization (EDGBCO) to address those problems in UAV path planning. In EDGBCO, several strategies are designed to enhance the algorithm’s performance. First, the dynamic partitioning strategy is utilized to flexibly divide the exploration and exploitation groups. Second, an adaptive update strategy is employed to enhance the search capability during the exploration phase. Last, we design the local solution strategy to take deep information exchange between the exploration and exploitation groups. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for UAV path planning, we compare the proposed algorithm with four swarm intelligence optimization algorithms in various scale scenarios from different perspectives. The experimental results shows that the UAV trajectories produced by the proposed algorithm are far superior to other algorithms under the same conditions. Moreover, the proposed algorithm provides more robust performance in generating UAV paths than other algorithms. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Path Planning; Swam Intelligence Optimization Algorithm; UAV","Aircraft exhibitions; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned underwater vehicles; Aerial vehicle; Dynamic groups; Group-based; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Swam intelligence; Swarm intelligence optimization algorithm; Swim intelligence optimization algorithm; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle path planning; Swarm intelligence","Y.

UAVs, serving as aerial base stations, enable vehicle network access and provide edge computing services in the absence of roadside units (RSUs). This study explores a multi-UAV-assisted vehicular network, where multiple UAVs collaboratively offer services to vehicles. The goal is to minimize task completion time by optimizing trajectory planning, spectrum resource allocation, and dynamic data offloading. An enhanced multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is introduced to address the optimization challenge in cooperative multi-UAV scenarios. Within this framework, each UAV, acting as an agent, devises strategies for movement, data offloading, and resource allocation based on the current states of vehicles and fellow UAVs.

One typical application of UAV swarm is regional target search, which involves obtaining target information through collaborative search by multiple machines. This article focuses on the dynamic target search problem with known probabilities and adversarial and avoidance capabilities. Based on Bayesian theory, the posterior probability of the target is calculated by considering its existence probability and detection process, and the probability graph is updated accordingly. Considering the evasion ability of the target, the UAV's search process towards the target is modeled as a Markov chain, and the impact of target evasion actions on the probability distribution of target existence is analyzed. A probability transition model for target existence under adversarial conditions is established, and the probability graph is predicted. To improve the probability of discovering targets within a limited area and time, a multi-UAV collaborative search path planning method is designed. Simulation results, compared with different algorithms, demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively simulate multi-UAV collaborative search scenarios under adversarial conditions, generate efficient search paths, and exhibit strong adaptability to different scenarios. © 2024 SPIE.","Bayesian theory; Confrontation strategy; Markov chain; Probability map; Target search; UAV swarm","Aircraft detection; Aircraft exhibitions; Maneuverability; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Bayesian theory; Collaborative searches; Condition; Confrontation strategy; Path planning method; Probability maps; Search path planning; Target search; Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm; Markov chains","X.

This paper focuses on the path planning and servo tracking problems of a designed Air-Ground collaborative unmanned system consisting of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). A systematic function implementation framework is designed to realize the autonomous driving of the UGV in an unknown environment and servo tracking of the UAV to the UGV. The simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology is used to perform the mapping of the UGV. With map information, this paper introduces a path planner that satisfies the incomplete constraints and continuous state space of the UGV. Then, the UGV is controlled to track the planned path to a designated target given by the UAV. Considering two different application scenarios according to whether the position information can be obtained, two servo tracking controllers are proposed based on proportional differential (PD) and image-based visual servo (IBVS), respectively. Simulations are conducted to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approaches. The results show that the IBVS controller performs better than the PD controller in the system oscillation and reaction rate. © Beijing HIWING Scientific and Technological Information Institute 2024.","Hybrid A*; IBVS; Path Planning; Servo Tracking","Air navigation; Aircraft control; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Controllers; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Mapping; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Air grounds; Autonomous navigation; Hybrid A*; Image-based visual servo; Motion-planning; Servo tracking; Tracking controls; Tracking problem; Unmanned system; Motion planning","H.

Multi-UAV path planning is a fundamental problem that is necessary for MUS navigation and finding non-collision trajectories at the same time. In this work, we study the current challenge of multiple multirotor UAV path planning and propose an innovative algorithm and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) decentralized communication architecture that is suitable for real-time multirotor UAV navigation without Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Existing algorithms and research are mostly finished on simulations and lack real flights to verify feasibility. Specifically, in order to achieve real-time applications, the proposed algorithm is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) due to its scalability and easy-to-implement, dubbed Accelerated Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (AIPSO). Nevertheless, standard PSO has two obvious drawbacks that might compromise our goal, slow convergence rate and easy falling into local optimal trajectories. The novelty in AIPSO overcomes two aforementioned PSO problems by introducing the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm and Dimensional Learning Strategy (DLS). Moreover, we restrain the number of particles to accelerate computations. Lastly, we integrated AIPSO with a decentralized communication architecture, called Decentralized Multi-UAV AIPSO (DMU-AIPSO). In order to verify the feasibility of DMU-AIPSO, both simulations and real flights are presented. © 2024, Institute of Navigation","","Flight simulators; Global positioning system; Motion planning; Navigation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Real time systems; Simulated annealing; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Collisions avoidance; Communication architectures; Decentralised; Decentralized communications; Multi UAV; Multirotors; Particle swarm; Swarm optimization; Time efficiencies; UAV systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Institute of Navigation","23303662","978-093640636-7","","","English","Proc.

Each functionality of a robot (e.g., sensory data acquisition, path planning, motion control, etc.) is executed within a so-called DataBlock of Filters shared through the internet, where each filter is computed either locally on the robot itself or remotely on a different robotic system. The data is stored and accessed via a so-called Temporal Addressable Memory (TAM), which acts as a gateway between each filter's input and output. CyberCortex.AI has two main components: (i) the CyberCortex.AI.inference system, which is a real-time implementation of the DataBlock running on the robots' embedded hardware, and (ii) the CyberCortex.AI.dojo, which runs on an HPC computer in the cloud, and it is used to design, train and deploy AI algorithms. We present a quantitative and qualitative performance analysis of the proposed approach using two collaborative robotics applications: (i) a forest fires prevention system based on an Unitree A1 legged robot and an Anafi Parrot 4K drone, as well as (ii) an autonomous driving system which uses CyberCortex.AI for collaborative perception and motion control. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","artificial intelligence; autonomous navigation; autonomous robots; distributed computing; embedded artificial intelligence; embedded systems; heterogeneous robots; multi-robot systems; robot autonomy; robotics operating systems","Analog storage; Collaborative robots; Deforestation; Digital storage; Fire control systems; Fire extinguishers; Fireproofing; Gateways (computer networks); Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Microrobots; Multipurpose robots; Robot Operating System; Robot programming; Automation applications; Autonomous navigation; Embedded artificial intelligence; Embedded-system; Heterogeneous robots; High performance computers; Multi-robot systems; Robot autonomy; Robotic operating system; Sensory data; Motion planning","S.

The AET problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) that aims at simultaneously minimizing the total AoI of GDs and total energy consumption of the UAV by optimizing its flight paths and task offloading ratios. Addressing the AET problem poses a significant challenge due to the inherent conflict between the two objectives. The existing methods cannot well address the MOP because they adopt the linear combination to transform an MOP into a single-objective optimization problem using fixed weights (i.e., preferences), ignoring the conflict between objectives. Moreover, user preferences may change over time in dynamic MEC systems. To overcome these challenges, we first build a multi-objective Markov decision process model with a vectorial reward for the AET problem. There are one-to-one relationships between each component of the reward and one of the two objectives. Then, we propose a multi-objective learning algorithm based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), which primarily comprises a training phase and an evolutionary phase. The former adopts multi-objective PPO to iteratively optimize multiple learning individuals, aiming to obtain a nondominated policy set. The latter employs a genetic operator to further improve the quality of each policy in the set. Specifically, the crossover and mutation operators operate at the parameter level of policy networks, avoiding stagnation and premature convergence. The experiment results validate that the proposed approach obtains a set of excellent nondominated policies and a favorable balance between objectives. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves improvements of at least 39.8%, 2.1%, and 15.3% regarding AoI, energy consumption, and cost compared with several algorithms.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Age of information; mobile edge computing; path planning; proximal policy optimization; reinforcement learning; task offloading; unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Iterative methods; Job analysis; Learning algorithms; Mathematical transformations; Mobile edge computing; Motion planning; Multiobjective optimization; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Age of information; Collaboration; Energy-consumption; Optimisations; Policy optimization; Proximal policy optimization; Reinforcement learnings; Task analysis; Task offloading; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Energy utilization","M.

Secondly, an aspect to consider the problem is the spoofing attack sent by tracking a target on both the GPS data transmission channel and the communication link connecting the UAV. A collaborative localization method is designed that utilizes in-group distance measurement and target ranging to solve trajectory deviation problems caused by such GPS spoofing attacks, where the identification of the attack is based on cumulative error.

In order to realize the autonomous maneuver of UAV in the process of cooperative air combat, a maneuver decision model for MAV-UAV cooperative air combat is designed on the basis of path planning technology. First, the dynamic grid environment is introduced to adaptively adjust the grid scale and resolution, so as to make up for the defect that, the larger the static grid environment planning space is, the lower the planning efficiency will be. Then, by taking the path planned using A star algorithm as the reference path, the ACO-A star hybrid path planning algorithm is proposed to improve the optimization efficiency of ACO algorithm. Finally, based on the mean clustering algorithm, a maneuver decision algorithm for MAV-UAV cooperative air combat is designed. The air combat simulation result shows that the proposed model has better decision correctness and can effectively improve the air combat victory rate. © 2023 Editorial Department of Advances in Aeronautical Science and Engineering.

Although several studies have offered UAV-assisted methods for enhancing the performance of existing networks by increasing coverage and capacity but the architectures of autonomous UAV networks based on artificial intelligence has not yet been thoroughly investigated. However, the most current models for logistics UAV delivery do not account for the energy consumption of logistics UAVs or the varying schedules of their clients, meaning they are not applicable to real-world transportation networks. As a result, for a smart transportation system, we suggest reducing the overall energy cost of various logistics UAVs throughout the time it takes to deliver individual items. In this research, we maximize the UAV power by posing the UAV path planning issue as a traveling salesman problem. The UAV route planning is optimized under the restrictions of node energy consumption and task deadlines to achieve maximum energy efficiency of cooperative computing over the course of a UAV's life cycle. A Deep Q Network (DQN) based path planning algorithm is suggested to adjust to the uncertain and changing environment over time. In comparison to other algorithms, the proposed one performs better in simulations, increases the computational productivity of dynamic computing by a large margin, and achieves a good equilibrium between the two energy inputs. We also think about minimizing the UAV's spin rate to maximize efficiency and decrease power consumption. By lowering the number of turns while still visiting all of the waypoints, our suggested technique uses 2-5 times less energy. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

The improved hybrid fireworks algorithm with differential evolution (HDEFWA) is put forward herein to handle the problem and yield optimal flyable paths for multi-UAVs. The UAV paths are expected to be safe and short, of which the cost function is modeled according to realistic scenarios. The proposed HDEFWA can generate the extra DE-sparks through the mutation, crossover, and selection operators using the highly ranked individuals, which greatly enhances the information sharing capacity among the better individuals and thus effectively strengthen the capacity to escape from local optima. To handle the multi-UAVs cooperative planning, the whole firework population in HDEFWA is divided into a series of parallel firework groups, and the information interaction mechanism is established to calculate the cooperative cost of solutions to achieve the collision-free among UAV paths. Simulation results demonstrate that our HDEFWA can effectively settle multi-UAVs cooperative path planning with the better performance than other population-based algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.","Cooperative path planning; Differential evolution; Fireworks algorithm; Multiple unmanned air vehicles","Antennas; Cost functions; Evolutionary algorithms; Explosives; Motion planning; Nonlinear programming; Aerial vehicle; Cooperative path planning; Cost-function; Differential Evolution; Evolution operation; Fireworks algorithms; Global path planning; Multiple unmanned air vehicle; Nonlinear optimization problems; Unmanned air vehicles; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","X.

However, when navigating through regions with partial coverage, such as rural areas, the task of planning the flight paths for these UAV missions becomes notably intricate. Algorithms designed to solve this issue require significant computational resources, making them infeasible for active deployment where an algorithm must run in real time using small compute power. Furthermore, these algorithms exponentially scale in run-time with respect to the number of UAVs being considered. To tackle this problem, we model the parameter space as a discrete grid-world, enable collaboration between drones, and gather supervised data from nonlinear programming and unsupervised data from a simulated version of the environment with associated rewards. We then train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) on this data and approximate optimal results by combining imitation and reinforcement learning methods. This DNN can successfully be deployed at fast speeds using relatively small computational power and can generalize to unseen maps where drone collaboration can be used to reduce mission time. By using the results of a network trained on supervised data as a guiding hand during training, our reinforcement learning approach achieves results better than either method in isolation.  © 2023 ACM.","cellular network; reinforcement learning; trajectory optimization; UAV","Antennas; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Motion planning; Nonlinear programming; Reinforcement learning; Wireless networks; Aerial vehicle; Cellular network; Cellulars; Imitation learning; Network connectivity; Partial coverage; Reinforcement learnings; Trajectory optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle mission; Drones","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","978-145039926-5","","","English","Proc.

The method is based on the Opposite Genetic Algorithms (OGA), which combines the actual task completion time with the balance of UAV inspection flight time, fault downtime, and maximum-minimum time load. A Task Balancing Opposite Chromosome Multiple Mutation Operator Genetic Algorithm (TOMGA) is introduced to solve the task load balancing problem by optimizing the task allocation among multiple UAVs with time as the optimization objective. Simulation results demonstrate that, this algorithm can effectively allocate inspection tasks to UAVs and generate initial flight routes. It resolves the issue of task load imbalance, improves the rationality of task allocation, enhances convergence speed, and overcomes the problem of local optima.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Flight simulators; Genetic algorithms; Inspection; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Flight time; Genetic operations; Inspection tasks; Load-Balancing; Minimum time; Multi objective; Multi UAV; Optimization method; Task allocation; Task completion time; Chromosomes","","","Institute of Physics","17426588","","","","English","J.

However, single 2D autonomous navigation systems fail in rough terrains. In this study, a solution to this problem is proposed using 2.5D navigation that takes into account the slopes on the elevation map. Using ROS and Gazebo, we coordinate drones and ground vehicles to process terrain elevations. The simulation world used in the study reflects a real-world rough terrain and also some urban artifacts are added to the simulation world. Husky simulation model is used as the ground vehicle utilizing 3D LIDAR, GPS and 9 DOF IMU sensors, which can output 3D map and 3D localization using 3D SLAM. Using the SLAM localization, a 2.5D map is created on the ground vehicle. Drone simulation model, similarly equipped, follows the ground vehicle with a GPS-based waypoint navigation and can create a 2.5D map using its sensors. A global plan is created for the ground vehicle by cooperative effort of both robots, using the map information from ground vehicle where available and using the map information from the drone where ground vehicle’s map is insufficient. 2.5D navigation of the ground vehicle is carried out by the local planner taking into account the calculated cooperative global path. Proposed method results in shorter routes and fewer path planning issues. This is shown by the comparative analysis where the ground vehicle or the drone is used alone. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2.5D outdoor navigation; 3D mapping; drone; elevation mapping; ground vehicle; heterogeneous robot teams; localization","Global positioning system; Ground vehicles; Information use; Mapping; Military operations; Motion planning; Robots; 2.5d outdoor navigation; 3-D mapping; Autonomous navigation systems; Elevation mapping; Elevation maps; Heterogeneous robot teams; Localisation; Outdoor navigation; Rough terrains; Simulation model; Drones","E.

We propose a path planning algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to serve network traffic in hotspot areas using spatio-temporal information about requests among the region of interest (RoI). The main task of a UAV is to provide communication services to users, while preparing for future hotspots. We propose a simple yet efficient trajectory design consisting of two phases: 1) targeting traffic for a single UAV, and 2) cooperative targeting for multiple UAVs. First, each UAV selects a long-term target considering future traffic and then a short-term target considering the present traffic. When UAVs encounter other UAVs, a cooperative targeting phase ensures UAVs serve traffic in different locations or with different statuses. Our trajectory design enables a UAV to construct its own path for a continuous UAV-enabled network. Simulation and real-world dataset-based experiments confirmed that our targeting scheme provides sufficient network service in a reasonable time, with an average service rate factor of up to 0.85, and an average service completion time relative to the deadline of up to 0.23. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm provides more stable performance compared to other existing algorithms.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Aerial base stations; network hotspot coverage; path planning; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Autonomous vehicles; Image segmentation; Motion planning; Three dimensional displays; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aerial vehicle; Disaster scenario; Hotspot coverage; Hotspots; Network communications; Networks services; Telecommunications traffic; Three-dimensional display; Trajectory designs; Vehicle's dynamics; Base stations","H.

Cross-domain collaborative search of unmanned platforms has been widely applied to military and civilian tasks. In this paper，Autonomous Underwater Vehicle （AUV） and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle （UAV）are used to perform the search and tracking tasks of underwater targets in offshore areas. The whole task process can be divided into two stages：target search and target tracking. The objective of the two stages is to maximize the total search space and minimize the end position error between AUV and underwater targets，respectively. Firstly，the search and tracking tasks are described，and the cross-domain collaborative search model of AUV&UAV is established. Secondly，various constraints such as navigation ability，detection distance and communication range in the cross-domain collaborative search model are set. Finally，in the cross-domain collaborative search and tracking planning，based on the improved genetic algorithm and the asynchronous planning strategy，the search and tracking paths are generated by centralized and distributed decision-making respectively. The simulation results show that the AUV&UAV cross-domain unmanned system can complete the underwater target search and tracking tasks under different conditions. © 2023 AAAS Press of Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

To enable diverse AI applications, numerous computation-intensive tasks (e.g., image recognition, video processing, path planning, etc.) that cannot be locally executed by UAVs need to be timely and effectively offloaded. Multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) integrated into a USV fleet is appealingly advocated to provide abundant computation resources for computation tasks. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient USV fleets-assisted collaborative computation offloading scheme for smart maritime services. Specifically, we first propose a collaborative computation offloading framework, where UAVs act as the requesters of computation offloading services, and USV fleets are the helpers. Then, the first-price sealed reverse auction with reserve price is utilized to incentivize USV fleets to assist in executing computation tasks of UAVs, where the reserve price guarantees the satisfied benefits of UAVs. Afterwards, to minimize the energy consumption of executing tasks within the USV fleet under the delay constraint, the joint allocation optimization scheme for computation subtasks and computation capacities is proposed based on the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the expected revenue and participation degree of the USV fleet and reduces the overall energy consumption of computation offloading compared to conventional schemes.  © 2024 IEEE.","Collaborative computation offloading; energy consumption optimization; smart maritime services; unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Computation offloading; Costs; Energy efficiency; Image recognition; Job analysis; Motion planning; Unmanned surface vehicles; Video signal processing; Collaboration; Collaborative computation; Collaborative computation offloading; Computation offloading; Computational modelling; Energy consumption optimization; Energy-consumption; Maritime services; Optimisations; Resource management; Smart maritime service; Task analysis; Energy utilization","Z.

Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology to facilitate the transfer of data from buoy sensor nodes, it becomes feasible to significantly reduce the latency generated in the transmission process. Therefore, we introduce a UAV-assisted maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) data collection mechanism based on relay cooperation. In this mechanism, through relay transmissions among UAVs, it avoids UAVs located distant from the shipboard station from having to traverse extensive distances in order to offload data to the shipboard station. Based on this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based cooperative data collection (DCDC) scheme. In this scheme, firstly, we select the convergence node in charge of forwarding the data from buoy sensor nodes to the passing UAVs. Next, to achieve dynamic adaptation of the task areas for UAVs, we propose an adaptive partition algorithm based on virtual moving points. Subsequently, to establish relay transmission links between UAVs, we present a routing algorithm based on matching game theory. Finally, to reduce time costs in delivering collected data to the shipboard station, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) plan the flight paths of UAVs. Additionally, we introduce virtual waypoints in the path planning algorithm, which enables that paired UAVs can high-efficiently perform data forwarding through encounter opportunities. Extensive simulation experiments have demonstrated that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of system Age of Information (AoI).  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Deep reinforcement learning; maritime Internet of Things (MIoT); relay cooperation; unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Data acquisition; Data transfer; Deep learning; Drones; Game theory; Heuristic algorithms; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Motion planning; Multi agent systems; Sensor nodes; Ships; Aerial vehicle; Data collection; Deep reinforcement learning; Heuristics algorithm; Maritime internet of thing; Reinforcement learnings; Relay; Relay cooperation; Task analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Reinforcement learning","G.

To solve the problems of low accuracy and efficiency in traditional single uav spectrum sensing, a multi-UAVs collaborative spectrum sensing method based on improved IDW algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a spectrum sensing model for collaborative exploration of multiple UAVs was constructed; Secondly, a spectral intensity cost factor is added to the cost function of UAV path planning, enabling UAVs to explore electromagnetic environment more efficiently; Finally, the accuracy of spectrum data completion is improved by combining IDW algorithm with propagation model. The simulation results show that the task completion time is reduced compared to current advanced path planning methods, and the accuracy of the completion algorithm is nearly 10dB higher than that of IDW and tensor completion methods, which has high practical value. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Inverse Distance Weighting Method; Path Planning; Spectrum Sensing; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Antennas; Cost functions; Information services; Inverse problems; Motion planning; Aerial vehicle; Co-operative spectrum sensing; Hotspots; Information networks; Inverse distance weighting method; Multi UAV; Spatial informations; Spectra's; Spectrum sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Z.

The approach uses a 3D model of the structure to generate viewpoints for the UAVs. The calculation of the viewpoints considers the constraints related to the UAV formation model, camera parameters, and requirements for data post-processing. The viewpoints are then used as input to formulate the path planning as an extended traveling salesman problem and the definition of a new cost function. Ant colony optimization is finally used to solve the problem to yield optimal inspection paths. Experiments with 3D models of real structures have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that our system is not only capable of generating feasible inspection paths for UAVs but also reducing the path length by 29.47% for complex structures when compared with another heuristic approach.

The map with dense and accurate risk information can help UGV avoid special obstacles such as steep slopes, pits, and ditches while path planning. To solve this problem, this article proposes an aerial-ground collaboration system for continuous risk mapping in off-road environments, utilizing the flexibility and perspective advantages of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the system, UAV carries a downward 2-D laser and a visual inertial system to construct a bird's eye map, while UGV is equipped with a 3-D LiDAR for local mapping. In detail, our system focuses on two aspects, which are cross-view map matching and collaborative continuous risk mapping. For cross-view map matching, risk values for point clouds from aerial and ground platforms are calculated and used for terrain segmentation. Then, point-to-voxel residual is built for terrain point sets to accelerate matching. For collaborative continuous risk mapping, an entropy based probabilistic fusion is proposed for accurate risk fusion of overlapping cells. Then, a Bayesian generalized kernel inference algorithm is adapted to predict risk values of the remaining unknown areas. Simulation and real-world experimental results show that the dense and continuous global risk map constructed by the proposed system can effectively assist UGV for path planning in off-road environments.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Collaborative mapping; information fusion; multirobot system; terrain risk estimation","Antennas; Ground vehicles; Inference engines; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Landforms; Mapping; Maps; Motion planning; Roads and streets; Three dimensional displays; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Collaboration; Collaborative mappings; Features extraction; Multi-robot systems; Point cloud compression; Point-clouds; Risk estimation; Robot sensing system; Terrain risk estimation; Three-dimensional display; Risk perception","W.

In large mission planning systems, demanding the effective completion of a wide variety of tasks, multi-UAV systems are significantly preferred. Collaborative task assignment and path planning have a significant impact on autonomous operation of multi-UAV systems. In this study, we propose a priority-aware task assignment and path planning (AMTP) algorithm based on actor-critic multi-agent reinforcement learning for multi-UAV operations. We utilize an actor-critic multi-agent framework based on centralized training and decentralized execution for task assignment and path planning of heterogeneous UAVs. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient framework is used to train the system to deal with both the elements of the dynamic environment and the heterogeneity of UAVs and tasks. The critic network evaluates the policy by maintaining the global network state information and combines the actions of agents to simplify the training state. On the other hand, agents decide which actions to comply with their local observations to improve the policy. The performance evaluation results obtained through simulation show that the proposed AMTP outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate, load balancing, energy efficiency, and convergence time. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Multi-UAV network; Optimization algorithm; Path planning; Reinforcement learning; Task assignment; Unmanned aerial vehicle","","S.

The freshness of collected information from sensors can be measured by the age of information (AoI), which is an important factor to consider in data collection. For data collection during long-term mission, the energy limitation of UAVs may cause mission interruption, which makes supplementation of the UAVs’ energy more necessary. To this end, we introduce the mobile unmanned vehicle (MUV) to guarantee the UAVs’ energy supplementation. In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-UAVs and single-MUV cooperative trajectory planning (MUSM-CTP) for data collection in WSNs with consideration for the AoI the collected data and the limited battery capacity of UAVs. The objective of this problem is to find cooperative flight trajectories for multiple UAVs and to determine the MUV’s travel plan to replace batteries for the UAVs, such that the average AoI of all collected data is minimized. We prove the NP-hardness of the problem and design the algorithm via three phases to solve this: determining candidate hover points based on the affinity propagation (AP) clustering method, constructing the flight trajectories of multiple UAVs based on the genetic algorithm (GA), and designing a travel plan for the MUV. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving the freshness of the information collected from all of the sensors. © 2023 by the authors.","age of information; cooperative trajectory planning; mobile unmanned vehicle; unmanned aerial vehicle; wireless sensor network","Fuzzy logic; Micro air vehicle (MAV); Nuclear batteries; Steganography; Wireless sensor networks; Aerial vehicle; Age of information; Cooperative trajectory planning; Data collection; Mobile unmanned vehicle; Sensors network; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle energy; Wireless sensor; Genetic algorithms","Y.

To fully exploit complementarities of these heterogeneous vehicles and improve efficiency of the cooperative monitoring, we design a novel cooperation scheme: each UAV is assigned to loiter over and transmit its observations to a pre-allocated UGV, and the UGV provides guidance on informative trajectories for the UAV and aims to reach a target position as fast as possible. Such a scheme brings challenges to informative trajectory planning of the UGVs, lying in the delayed observations from the UAVs and the cumulative information constraint depending on the unknown field. To overcome them, this work proposes a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based trajectory planning method to learn continuous policies for the UGVs, where a field estimator is designed for each UGV to recover observability of the field. In addition, we derive model predictive control (MPC)-based trajectory planners for the UAVs with tailored reference positions, where the uncertain tracking errors can be handled by the RL-based method of the UGVs. Thus, a performance coupling problem of the heterogeneous vehicles is tackled. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning methods and the efficiency of the air-ground cooperative monitoring scheme. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This article is motivated by cooperative monitoring tasks with UAVs and UGVs in practical applications, such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue after disasters, etc. Due to the complex dynamics of spatiotemporal fields in these tasks, trajectory planning for the cooperative monitoring system is challenging and requires much computations. To resolve the issues, we propose a novel cooperation scheme in this article, where the large computational capability of the UGVs is utilized to solve a minimum-time trajectory planning problem under a cumulative information constraint, and the UAVs only loiter over and transmit measurements about the field to the UGVs. To achieve this scheme, RL-based and MPC-based trajectory planning methods are proposed for the UGVs and the UAVs, respectively. Simulations have validated the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning methods and good performance of the cooperative monitoring system.

To solve these issues above, a multi-UAV cooperative search (MUCS) method in the uncertain urban environment is proposed. Firstly, the urban environment is modeled, which includes the design of dense building clusters and targets with various motion states, so as to enhance the challenge of the target search task. Then on this basis, a cooperative optimization model based on information sharing cost and regional coverage benefit is constructed by comprehensively considering the flight constraint and the information interaction capability of UAV formation. Finally, according to the characteristics of the multi-UAV cooperative formation, the swarm intelligence method is used to solve the optimization problem? which ensures that each UAV can obtain the feasible solution of the optimal path and improve the efficiency of the multi-UAV cooperative target search. Compared with the existing search methods, the average target discovery success rate of MUCS method is increased by 20%, and the regional coverage rate is increased by 10%.

Existing research has focused on how to provide efficient communication services to rescuers in static scenarios with a limited UAV spectrum and battery capacity. However, the location movement and service changes of communication rescuers in real scenarios lead to the failure of static schemes. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a collaborative UAVs scheduling algorithm through the convergence of communication, sensing and computing. First, we perform sensing the environmental information, i.e., the rescuers' historical location information and service demand, in real-time to realize the prediction of the rescuers' future location and service demand and provide a priori information for the scheduling of UAVs. Second, an improved J-sums algorithm is proposed to deploy the UAVs' location concerning the UAV load constraint to achieve UAVs' load balancing. Furthermore, a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to optimize the UAVs' transmit power to ensure rescuers' communication service quality under a limited bandwidth. Compared to static scenarios where rescuer-UAV associations are established based on signaFto-noise ratios, the proposed UAV scheduling algorithm through the convergence of communication, sensing and computing in this paper can effectively improve network utility (network communication benefits minus communication costs) by 20%. The algorithm provides a guaranteed business experience for rescuers in emergency disaster relief scenarios. © 2023 Science Press.

However, the resulting mechanical coupling of the UAVs imposes new challenges in terms of tracking control. Thus, we design a geometric trajectory tracking controller for the cooperative task of four quadrotor UAVs carrying and transporting a rigid body, which is attached to the quadrotors via inflexible elastic cables. The elasticity of the cables together with techniques of singular perturbation allows a reduction in the model to that of a similar model with inelastic cables. In this reduced model, we design a controller such that the position and attitude of the load exponentially converge to a given desired trajectory. We then show that this result leads to a uniformly converging tracking error for the original elastic model under some assumptions. Furthermore, under the presence of unstructured disturbances on the system, we show that the error is ultimately bounded with an arbitrarily small bound.

The objective is to generate optimal candidate paths for each UCAV, ensuring they reach the destination simultaneously while considering time variables and obstacle avoidance. To overcome the limitations of the standard artificial ecosystem optimizer (AEO), such as local optimality and slow convergence, a learning framework inspired by brain-like perception is constructed. This framework enhances swarm agents with greater intelligence by fusing swarm intelligence and human cognitive mechanisms. Meanwhile, a multi-strategy database is implemented within the evolutionary learning framework to replace the single-update method of the AEO during the consumption phase. To reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, agents in the consumption stage utilize experience accumulation from reinforcement learning to select an effective update strategy for obtaining the latest consumer location.

Firstly, a heterogeneous UAV collaborative reconnaissance model with multiple payloads is established. Taking the shortest path as the objective function, an improved Harris hawks algorithm is designed to solve the model. Secondly, the reverse learning mechanism is used to initialize the population, which is conducive to increasing the diversity of the population and improving the quality of the solution. Differential variation disturbance is used in the early stage of the algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed, and the Gaussian distribution function coefficient is used in the later stage of the algorithm to reduce the possibility of falling into local optimum, so as to avoid premature maturity of the algorithm.

However, due to the limitation of battery capacity, the endurance of existing UAVs is limited, making it difficult for them to directly undertake information collection, cruising, and inspection tasks over large work areas. This paper considers the problem of path allocation for multiple UAVs to minimize work time and reports research on multi-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) multi-task long-duration operation path planning. We propose a multi-UAV collaborative search algorithm based on the greedy algorithm (MUCS-GD) and a multi-UAV collaborative search algorithm based on the binary search algorithm (MUCS-BSAE), and later apply two UAV collaborative search algorithms to five UAV flight paths: (1) a snake curve path, (2) a “square wave signal” curve path, (3) a Peano curve path, (4) a Hilbert curve path, and (5) a Moore curve path, and compare the simulation results. We found that the performance of MUCS-BSAE was better than that of MUCS-GD in all of the above flight paths. In addition, the path with the “square wave signal” curve was the near-optimal path among all the flight paths. Finally, we improved the MUCS-BSAE applied on the “square wave signal” curve path and obtained an improved collaborative search algorithm for multiple UAVs based on the binary search algorithm (IMUCS-BSAE), which further reduced the working time of the UAV. © 2023 by the authors.","collaborative unmanned aerial vehicle teams; coverage path planning (CPP); multiple traveling salesmen problems (MTSP); path planning; predictive task assignment; task allocation; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","S.

This paper proposes a multi-UAV mission planning model that takes into account mission execution rates, flight energy consumption costs, and impact costs. A kinematics and dynamics model of a quadcopter UAV is established, and the UAV’s flight state is analyzed. Due to the difficulties in addressing 3D UAV kinematic constraints and poor uniformity using traditional optimization algorithms, a lightning search algorithm (LSA) based on multi-layer nesting and random walk strategies (MNRW-LSA) is proposed. The convergence performance of the MNRW-LSA algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with several other algorithms, such as the Golden Jackal Optimization (GJO), Hunter–Prey Optimization (HPO), Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA), Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA), and the Golden Eagle Optimization (GEO) using optimization test functions, Friedman and Nemenyi tests. Additionally, a greedy strategy is added to the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm to initialize the trajectories for simulation experiments using a 3D city model. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can enhance global convergence and robustness, shorten convergence time, improve UAV execution coverage, and reduce energy consumption. Compared with other algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), and LSA, the proposed method has greater advantages in addressing multi-UAV trajectory planning problems. © 2023 by the authors.","lightning search algorithm; multi-layer nesting strategy; path planning; quadcopter UAV; urban patrol","Decision trees; Flight simulators; Flow visualization; Interpolation; Motion planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Random forests; Strategic planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Lightning search algorithm; Multi-layer nesting strategy; Multi-layers; Nesting strategies; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicle; Search Algorithms; Urban patrol; Simulated annealing","N.

However, providing low-latency services solely from an overall perspective cannot ensure a high quality of experience (QoE) for user equipments (UEs). Therefore, we propose a service experience-oriented cooperative caching framework, where the UAVs can effectively serve each UE by providing communication and computing resources. A novel metric called service experience ratio is defined to reflect the experience at the UEs. Under the constraints of UAV's energy budget and delay requirements, we consider jointly optimizing task offloading, resource allocation, trajectory planning, and service caching placement to maximize the service experience ratio. Since the original problem is a mixed-integer non-convex programming problem with a fractional structure, it is challenging to be solved in polynomial time. Based on Dinkelbach's method and convex optimization theory, we simplify the problem model and propose a four-stage alternating iterative service ratio maximization algorithm to solve this problem. Besides, we also analyze the convergence and complexity of our proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the service experience ratio achieved by the proposed algorithm is 19-34% higher than the comparative works. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Caching placement; edge computing; resource allocation; task offloading; UAV trajectory","Antennas; Autonomous vehicles; Budget control; Convex optimization; Cooperative communication; Integer programming; Iterative methods; Job analysis; Mobile edge computing; Nonlinear programming; Polynomial approximation; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Caching placement; Delay; Edge computing; Optimisations; Resource management; Resources allocation; Task analysis; Task offloading; Unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory; Vehicle trajectories; Trajectories","L.

In the proposed general framework, firstly, the multi-population mean field game is used to plan the optimal trajectory of an agent between each pair of priority adjacent task nodes, and the minimum costs are calculated. Then, based on the discrete time finite state space mean field game, a task assignment model in the discrete task space is constructed, and the minimum costs obtained in the trajectory planning are coupled into the model as a reference, the task assignment strategies are finally obtained. Moreover, we give a specific example of the proposed general framework and prove the existence of equilibrium solutions of two mean field games.

Examples include the collaborative exploration of multiple task areas by UAV swarm, and the lane selection and efficient driving of autonomous vehicles. There are many methods for dealing with the integrated task assignment and trajectory planning. However, they have difficulties in dealing with large-scale agent problems, mainly due to the significant increase in communication and computation costs as the number of agents increases. In response to this problem, based on the characteristic of mean field game that transforms the game between individuals into a game between an individual and the whole, this paper proposes a general framework of bilayer-coupled mean field games for the scenario with different priority task nodes and multiple static obstacles. The multi-population mean field game is used to plan the optimal trajectory of agents, and the discrete time finite state space mean field game is utilized for task assignment, in which the cost of trajectory planning between task nodes is considered. We propose a specific example model and theoretically prove the existence of an equilibrium solution of this model.

However, due to poor cooperation, most existing CPP methods may cause strongly overlapped trajectories, missing areas, or even collisions in uncertain and complex environments, leading to long task completion time and low coverage efficiency. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel multi-UAV distributed online cooperation (MDOC) CPP method that aims to minimize task completion time. Moreover, this method allows UAVs to quickly respond to unknown obstacles and complex emergencies, such as UAV breakdown or communication interruption. To establish close cooperation between UAVs, we propose an efficient environmental information map (EI-map) fusion technique that enables them to obtain global exploration in real-time in a cooperative manner. Then we innovatively develop a distributed cooperative deep Q-learning (DCDQN) algorithm to obtain UAVs' coverage paths online that are determined by minimizing task time and avoiding overlaps, missing areas, and collisions. Specifically, attributing to the fused EI-map, we expand the state space of DCDQN to collect sufficient observations and design a novel cooperative learning pattern to efficiently plan the path for global optimization. Simulation results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in task completion time and coverage efficiency, especially in uncertain and complex environments. In addition, we validate that our method can efficiently complete full coverage even in emergencies. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Coverage path planning (CPP); distributed cooperative deep Q-learning algorithm (DCDQN); environmental information map (EI-map); multi-UAV distributed online cooperation (MDOC)","Antennas; Deep learning; Efficiency; Global optimization; Learning algorithms; Online systems; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Atmospheric modeling; Coverage path planning; Distributed cooperative deep Q-learning algorithm; Environmental information; Environmental information map; Information map; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle distributed online cooperation; Optimisations; Q-learning; Q-learning algorithms; Simulation; Task analysis; Motion planning","Y.

In this case, solutions besides original architecture are needed to meet the requirements of communication. Since unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be quickly sent to disaster events to provide temporary connection due to its agility and mobility, it is suitable for performing disaster relief. Nevertheless, the limited onboard energy restricts the UAVs from fulfilling such persistent tasks. To this end, we introduce a ground vehicle carrying backup batteries to handle the energy issue of the UAV. Considering a time-constrained disaster-affected area, we propose a cooperative trajectory planning scheme to provide emergency communications swiftly and timely. The goal of our optimization task is to minimize the total cost of the mission, which consists of the operation cost for mission completion and the penalty cost for latency. We show that the task can be regarded as an extension of traveling salesman problem with soft time window constraints, which is NP-hard in general, and we propose a novel attention-based deep reinforcement learning with a sequential model strategy to learn the policy for the UAV's visiting order, based on which the trajectories of the UAV and ground vehicle are jointly designed.

However, in these environments, UAVs lose their line-of-sight (LOS) communication with the ground station (GS) due to the obstruction of the mountains and are unable to retransmit information such as video, which will lead to mission failure or affect the flight safety of UAVs. To address this difficulty, this study proposes a cooperative planning method for heterogeneous UAVs by ensuring steady communication based on the shortest total mission time. To accomplish this goal, a relay UAV is positioned to enable indirect but constant LOS connectivity between the mission UAV and the GS. Specifically, to alleviate data storage pressure, a terrain lightweight modeling method is employed. In addition, a new LOS judgment model that constructs communication relay LOS links between communication nodes for complex mountain environments is presented. This study considers different types of UAVs; for the fixed-wing UAV, the minimum turning radius constraints are taken into account to plan a flyable trajectory. The problem is formulated as the multi-step optimization model that accounts for communication constraints, obstacle and collision avoidance, and the performance constraints of heterogeneous UAVs to plan the trajectories of the mission UAV and relay UAV in order to maintain LOS links between the mission UAV and the ground station. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and ensures the completion of cooperative exploration missions for heterogeneous UAVs in complex mountain environments. © 2016 IEEE.","collision avoidance; communication relay; heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles; Motion and path planning; terrain modeling","Antennas; Collision avoidance; Digital storage; Fixed wings; Landforms; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aerial vehicle; Collisions avoidance; Communication relays; Ground stations; Heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle; Motion and path planning; Optimisations; Relay; Terrain Modeling; Trajectory Planning; Trajectories","L.

However, the utilization of UAV swarms in sustainable transportation also presents some challenges, such as inefficient task allocation and data transmission security issues, highlighting the importance of privacy protection in this context. To address these issues, this study applies blockchain technology to multi-UAV tasks and proposes a blockchain-based multi-UAV task processing system for situation awareness and real-time decisions. The primary objective of this system is to enhance the efficiency of UAV swarm task scheduling, bolster data transmission security, and address privacy protection concerns. Utilizing the highly secure features of blockchain technology, the system constructs a distributed task processing network. System tasks are stored in the blockchain through smart contracts, ensuring the immutability and verifiability of task information. Smart contracts have an automatic execution capability, whereby the system can efficiently coordinate tasks and maintain the consistency of task execution information through consensus mechanisms. Additionally, adopting the Pointer Network structure for intelligent path planning based on task allocation results leads to the attainment of the shortest service routes, consequently expanding the service coverage of sustainable transportation systems while reducing energy consumption. This further advances the realization of urban sustainable transportation. Through experimental results, we verify that the proposed system enables real-time task scheduling and collaborative processing for multiple UAVs, significantly enhancing the efficiency, security, and privacy protection level of UAV swarm task execution in the context of sustainable transportation. It makes a positive contribution to building more sustainable urban transportation systems. © 2023 by the authors.","blockchain; path planning; privacy protection; smart contracts; task scheduling; UAV","Calabarzon; Philippines; Quezon; Real; data transmission; logistics; real time; remotely operated vehicle; security threat; transportation system","X.

Common map navigation software also fails to provide a passable path. Therefore, only Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) can be used in field rescues. However, ground vehicles have limited awareness of their surroundings, so we chose to set up an air-ground cooperative system to overcome these vehicles' shortcoming. In the air-ground cooperative system, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can provide environmental images surrounding the SUV for the ground terminal to obtain the navigation path of the vehicle by quickly extracting the type of surface and terrain undulations in the images. To better meet the above application requirement, this paper improves the existing A* algorithm with three main innovations. First, we proposed a passability cost function that integrates surface type and surface elevation information considering the application characteristics of the outdoor surface environment. Second, we proposed a fast path search algorithm based on grid cells given the scale relationship between the resolution of UAV images and the actual vehicle paths. Third, we chose the marginal feature points of the grid for the passability path search in view of the connected surface-type distribution inside the grid cell. This approach improves the search efficiency of the algorithm while taking into account the terrain information inside the grid cell, such that the algorithm could make full use of the detailed information of the UAV images and optimize the calculation. The 3D visualization experiments show that the paths searched by the Grid A* algorithm are more reliable and meet the needs of SUVs. The Grid A* algorithm proposed in this paper, aiming at the high-resolution images obtained by UAV, synthesizes image classification, slope calculation, and other methods to structure a passability cost function so that the paths are more reliable. In addition, the time cost of the algorithm is reduced to 15% of the traditional A* algorithm, which improves the timeliness of emergency rescue in the field. © 2024 Science Press.

Search path planning is a critical factor to improve multi-UAV search performance. Aiming at the search inefficiency resulting from insufficient cooperation between UAVs in existing researches, we present a novel distributed real-time search path planning method based on distributed model predictive control (DMPC) framework. Firstly, we formulate the overall search objective function in finite time domain, considering not only repeated searches, but also maintenance of connectivity and collision avoidance between UAVs. Secondly, we decompose the overall search objective function to establish a distributed constrained optimization problem (DCOP) model, so that all UAVs optimize the overall search objective by interacting with neighbors. Thirdly, aiming at the problem of falling into the local optima in existing algorithms, distributed stochastic algorithm based on enhanced genetic algorithm (DSA-EGA) is proposed to solve the established DCOP model. We design a point crossover operator and introduce anytime local search (ALS) framework that stores the global optimal solution explored. Finally, the simulation results of different benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed DSA-EGA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the quality of solution. The simulation results of cooperative area search problems illustrate that the established DCOP model improves the search efficiency by 7.7%, and DSA-EGA improves the search efficiency by 4.3% at least. In addition, we also verify that our method has high scalability.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.","cooperative area search; distributed constrained optimization problem; distributed genetic algorithm; distributed model predictive control; Multi-UAV","Antennas; Benchmarking; Constrained optimization; Efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Interactive computer systems; Linear programming; Model predictive control; Motion planning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Cooperative area search; Distributed constrained optimisation; Distributed constrained optimization problem; Distributed genetic algorithms; Distributed Model predictive Control; Linear-programming; Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle; Optimisations; Predictive control; Real - Time system; Search problem; Time-domain analysis; Real time systems","J.

Dual- or multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation schemes are required for heavy loads. In this work, focusing on the path planning for a dual-quadrotor cooperative transport system, a unique artificial potential field-A*(APF-A*) algorithm is studied to fulfill the safe and effective cooperative suspension transport. APF-A* algorithm proposed the strategy of host-wingman cooperative transportation based on the APF theory, and optimizes the heuristic function by introducing the concept of repulsive force to maintain the quadrotor flying at a safe distance from the obstacle. In addition, APF-A* algorithm promises to increase search efficiency while identifying the optimal path, and it can reduce the swing angle motion of loads to enhance the security of transportation. The coordinated flight control and path planning of quadrotor UAVs are simulated in AirSim environment and tested in flight experiments. The results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable to plan safe and reliable paths, meanwhile changing formation and avoid collision when the wingman is close to obstacles. In comparison to the regular A* algorithm, the APF-A* algorithm proposed in the paper performs better in path planning for dual-quadrotor cooperative transport system, reducing the search time and the number of search grids by nearly 60% and 53.75%, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial potential field-A* algorithm; Cooperative transportation; Heuristic algorithm; Optimal performance; Path planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Automobile suspensions; Heuristic algorithms; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); A* algorithm; Aerial vehicle; Artificial potential field-A* algorithm; Artificial potential fields; Cooperative transportation; Heuristics algorithm; Optimal performance; Quad rotors; Transport systems; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Motion planning","M.

First, the cost mathematical model of cooperative search for multiple UAVs was established. At the same time, considering the limitation of turning radius of UAVs, a Dubins curve coverage search strategy was proposed to avoid search blind areas. Second, the judgment conditions of 'edge length threshold' and 'angle threshold' were introduced, and the method of selective removal of concave points was proposed to transform the irregular concave polygon area into a regular convex polygonal area. Then, to reduce the searching cost of UAV's ' $\Omega $ ' turning type and improve the timeliness of its submarine search, a strategy of UAV cluster cooperative coverage search in the form of parallel interval was proposed. Finally, a comparative verification experiment was designed for the strategy of SCSDC and SCSPI in a complex irregular polygon search area. The simulation results show that selection of the two different area coverage search strategies needs to be determined according to actual combat requirements.

Within this framework, we initially ascertain optimal task locations for capturing images by assessing scene reconstructability, thereby enhancing the overall quality of reconstructions. Furthermore, we curtail energy costs of trajectories by allocating task sequences, characterized by minimal corners and lengths, among multiple UAVs. Ultimately, we integrate considerations of energy costs, safety, and reconstructability into a unified optimization process, facilitating the search for optimal paths for multiple UAVs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in facilitating collaborative full-scene image captures by multiple UAVs, achieving low energy costs while attaining high-quality 3D reconstructions. © 2023 by the authors.","continuous path planning; cooperation; image capture; multi-UAV; scene reconstruction","3D reconstruction; Digital elevation model; Direct air capture; Flight paths; Motion planning; 3d scenes reconstruction; Aerial vehicle; Continuous path planning; Cooperation; Energy cost; High resolution; Image captures; Large-scales; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle; Scene reconstruction; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","G.

In this study, we propose a cooperative exploration approach that uses multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our approach allows UAVs to explore separate areas dynamically, resulting in increased efficiency and decreased redundancy. We use a novel dynamic centroid-based method to partition the 3D working area for each UAV, with each UAV generating new targets in its partitioned area only using the onboard computational resource. To ensure the cooperation and exploration of the unknown, we use a next-best-view (NBV) method based on rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), which generates a tree in the partitioned area until a threshold is reached. We compare this approach with three classical methods using Gazebo simulation, including a Voronoi-based area partition method, a coordination method for reducing scanning repetition between UAVs, and a greedy method that works according to its exploration planner without any interaction. We also conduct practical experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2023 by the authors.","area partition; collaborative exploration; path planning; swarm UAVs","Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Area partition; Collaborative exploration; Cooperative exploration; Critical issues; Decentralised; ITS applications; Research interests; Search and rescue; Swarm unmanned aerial vehicle; Decision trees","B.

However, in practical applications, it is difficult to achieve formation keeping precisely and obstacle avoidance autonomously at the same time. This paper proposes a joint control method based on robust H∞ controller and improved Artificial Potential Field (APF) method. Firstly, we build a formation flight model based on the “Leader-Follower” structure and design a robust H∞ controller with three channels X, Y and Z to eliminate dynamic uncertainties, so as to realize high-precision formation keeping. Secondly, to fulfill obstacle avoidance efficiently in complex situations where UAVs fly at high speed with high inertia, this paper comes up with the improved APF method with deformation factor considered. The judgment criterion is proposed and applied to ensure flight safety. In the end, the simulation results show that the designed controller is effective with the formation keeping a high accuracy and in the meantime, it enables UAVs to avoid obstacles autonomously and recover the formation rapidly when coming close to obstacles. Therefore, the method proposed here boasts good engineering application prospect. © 2023 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics","Artificial potential field (APF); Flight control systems; Formation flight; Multi-UAV; Trajectory planning","Aircraft control; Antennas; Controllers; Flight control systems; Aerial vehicle; Artificial potential field; Artificial potential fields; Flight-control systems; Formation flight; Formation keeping; H ∞ controllers; Multi UAV; Obstacles avoidance; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","H.

To ensure robust perching, tracking with a steady relative state and reliable perception is a prerequisite. This paper presents an adaptive dynamic tracking and perching scheme for autonomous quadrotors to achieve tight integration with moving platforms. For reliable perception of dynamic targets, we introduce elastic visibility aware planning to actively avoid occlusion and target loss. Additionally, we propose a flexible terminal adjustment method that adapts the changes in flight duration and the couple d terminal states, ensuring full state synchronization with the time varying perching surface at various angles. A relaxation strategy is developed by optimizing the tangential relative speed to address the dynamics and safety violations brought by hard bo undary conditions. Moreover, we take SE(3) motion planning into account to ensure no collision until the contact moment. Furthermore, we propose an efficient spatiotemporal trajectory optimization framework considerin g full state dynamics The proposed method is extensively tested through benchmark comparisons and ablation studies. To facilitate the application of academic research to industry and to validate the efficiency under strictly limited computational resources, we deploy our system on a commercial drone (DJI MAVIC3) with a full size sport utility vehicle (SUV). We conduct extensive real world experiments, where the drone successfully tracks and perches at 30 km/h (8.3 m/ s) on the top of the SUV, and at 3.5∼m/s with 60° inclined into the trunk of the SUV.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Aerial system; motion and path planning; perception and autonomy; trajectory optimization","Aerodynamics; Antennas; Commercial vehicles; Drones; Efficiency; Industrial research; Motion planning; Target tracking; Adaptive tracking; Aerial systems; Motion and path planning; Moving platform; Perception and autonomy; Quad rotors; Sport utility vehicles; Targets tracking; Trajectory optimization; Vehicle's dynamics; Trajectories","F.

When UAVs search for moving targets in a mission area, the targets can perceive the positions and flight direction of UAVs within certain limits and take corresponding evasive actions, which makes the search more challenging than traditional search problems. To address this problem, we first define a detailed motion model for such targets and design various search information maps and their update methods to describe the environmental information based on the prediction of moving targets and the search results of UAVs. We then establish a multi-UAV search path planning optimization model based on the model predictive control, which includes various newly designed objective functions of search benefits and costs. We propose a priority-encoded improved genetic algorithm with a fine-adjustment mechanism to solve this model. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the cooperative search efficiency, and more targets can be found at a much faster rate compared to traditional search methods. © The Author(s) 2023.","fine-adjustment mechanism; moving target search; path planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","","Z.

In this study, we focus on how to utilize multiple UAVs to efficiently cover the target area in ocean data monitoring tasks. First, we propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based path-planning method for multiple UAVs to perform efficient coverage tasks in a target area in the field of ocean data monitoring. Additionally, the traditional Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) algorithm only considers the current state of the agents, leading to poor performance in path planning. To address this issue, we introduce an improved MATD3 algorithm with the integration of a stacked long short-term memory (S-LSTM) network to incorporate the historical interaction information and environmental changes among agents.

The lack of reliable and accurate positioning means is one of the main difficulties faced by rescuers. In the absence of prior knowledge of the high-rise building fire environment, the coverage deployment of mobile base stations is a challenging problem that has not received much attention in the literature. This paper studies the problem of the autonomous optimal deployment of base stations in high-rise building fire environments based on a UAV group. A novel problem formulation is proposed that solves the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) positioning problem in complex and unknown environments. The purpose of this paper is to realize the coverage and deployment of mobile base stations in complex and unknown fire environments. The NLOS positioning problem in the fire field environment is turned into the line-of-sight (LOS) positioning problem through the optimization algorithm. And there are more than three LOS base stations nearby at any point in the fire field. A control law which is formulated in a mathematically precise problem statement is developed that guarantees to meet mobile base stations’ deployment goals and to avoid collision. Finally, the positioning accuracy of our method and that of the common method were compared under many different cases. The simulation result showed that the positioning error of a simulated firefighter in the fire field environment was improved from more than 10 m (the positioning error of the traditional method) to less than 1 m. © 2023 by the authors.","autonomous deployment; collaborative positioning; fire rescue; swarm intelligence; trajectory planning","Base stations; Fires; Tall buildings; Autonomous deployment; Collaborative positioning; Fire environment; Fire rescue; High-rise building fire; Mobile base station; Nonline of sight; Trajectory Planning; algorithm; article; fire fighter; human; intelligence; simulation; Swarm intelligence","Y.

It combines the flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the high payload capacity of vehicles, expanding the service range of UAVs while reducing carbon emissions. However, most existing research has focused on path planning and resource allocation for either UAVs or vehicles alone. Therefore, to address the shortcomings of the current research, this paper proposes an intelligent land–air collaboration delivery algorithm for trajectory optimization and resource scheduling. Subsequently, this paper develops a land–air collaboration reliable delivery logistics distribution system, showcasing the driving routes of vehicles and UAVs.

A multi-UAV cooperative path is a combination of single-UAV paths, so the idea of problem decomposition is effective to deal with multi-UAV cooperative path planning. With this analysis, a multi-UAV cooperative path planning algorithm based on co-evolution optimization was proposed in this paper. Firstly, by analyzing the meaning of multi-UAV cooperative flight, the optimization model of multi-UAV cooperative path planning was given. Secondly, we designed the cost function of multiple UAVs with the penalty function method to deal with multiple constraints and designed two information-sharing strategies to deal with the combination path search between multiple UAVs. The two information-sharing strategies were called the optimal individual selection strategy and the mixed selection strategy. The new cooperative path planning algorithm was presented by combining the above designation and co-evolution algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to a rendezvous task in complex environments and compared with two evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively cope with the multi-UAV cooperative path planning problem in complex environments. © 2023 by the authors.","co-evolution algorithm; multi-UAV cooperative path planning; path planning","Consensus algorithm; Evolutionary algorithms; Information dissemination; Motion planning; Optimization algorithms; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Co-evolution; Co-evolution algorithm; Complex environments; Cooperative path planning; Evolution algorithms; Information sharing strategies; Multi UAV; Multi-UAV cooperative path planning; Multiple UAVs; Path-planning algorithm; Cost functions","X.

APF provides environmental awareness and implicit coordination to UAVs, while PSO searches for collision-free and energy-efficient trajectories for each UAV in a decentralized manner under the implicit coordination. This decentralized approach is achieved by minimizing a novel cost function that leverages the advantages of the active contour model from image processing. Additionally, future trajectories are predicted by approximating the minima of the novel cost function using calculus of variation, which enables proactive actions and defines the initial conditions for PSO.

Suction cups are usually adopted for surface attachment due to their durability and large adhesive force. To seal on a surfaces, suction cups must be aligned with the surface and possess proper relative tangential velocity. However, quadrotors' attitude and relative velocity errors would become significant when the object surface is moving and inclined. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time trajectory planning algorithm. The time-optimal aggressive trajectory is efficiently generated through multimodal search in a dynamic time-domain. The velocity errors relative to the moving surface are alleviated. To further adapt to the residual errors, we design a compliant gripper using self-sealing cups. Multiple cups in different directions are integrated into a wheel-like mechanism to increase the tolerance to attitude errors. The wheel mechanism also eliminates the requirement of matching the attitude and tangential velocity. Extensive tests are conducted to perch on static and moving surfaces at various inclinations. Results demonstrate that our proposed system enables a quadrotor to reliably perch on moving inclined surfaces (up to 1.07m/s and 90°) with a success rate of 70% or higher. The efficacy of the trajectory planner is also validated. Our gripper has larger adaptability to attitude errors and tangential velocities than conventional suction cup grippers. The success rate increases by 45% in dynamic perches. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the problem of perching on moving inclined surfaces using quadrotors. It can be used for perching on the various angled surfaces of an automobile to save energy and enlarge flight distance. It can also be exploited in air-ground cooperative tasks. In recent years, various grippers and trajectory planning methods have been devised to enable quadrotors to perch on static inclined surfaces. These strategies can not be used for perching on moving inclined surfaces. The task poses high requirements for the efficiency of trajectory planning and the grippers' adaptability to pose errors. This paper proposes a real-time planning method to generate trajectories. The trajectories respect kinematic and motor lift constraints. They allow large attitude maneuvering of quadrotors. A multimodal search in a dynamic time-domain is developed to seek the minimum feasible time for the trajectory planner. Considering large pose errors in dynamic perching, a compliant gripper based on multiple independent suction cups is designed. The wheel and multidirectional layout of cups increase the adaptability to attitude and velocity errors. Results suggest that the proposed system is effective and reliable. In practice, our multiple cups would add weight penalty and increase the drag. The suction cups should be placed close to a quadrotor's central axis to reduce the drag and disturbance in flow. The proposed system relies on an external motion capture system. In future research, we will focus on onboard sensing and control methods to achieve perching on moving inclined surfaces outdoors.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","gripper; perching; suction cup; trajectory planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamics; Errors; Grippers; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Wheels; Aerial vehicle; Inclined surface; Perching; Quad rotors; Real - Time system; Suction cup; Tangential velocities; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle's dynamics; Trajectories","X.

With the disruptive transformation of artificial intelligence technology, autonomous trajectory planning based on intelligent algorithms has emerged as a key technique for enhancing UAVs’ capacity for autonomous behavior, thus holding significant research value. To address the challenges of UAV trajectory planning in complex 3D environments, this paper proposes a multi-UAV cooperative trajectory-planning method based on a Modified Cheetah Optimization (MCO) algorithm. Firstly, a spatiotemporal cooperative trajectory planning model is established, incorporating UAV-cooperative constraints and performance constraints. Evaluation criteria, including fuel consumption, altitude, and threat distribution field cost functions, are introduced. Then, based on its parent Cheetah Optimization (CO) algorithm, the MCO algorithm incorporates a logistic chaotic mapping strategy and an adaptive search agent strategy, thereby improving the home-returning mechanism. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted using a considerably large test dataset containing functions with the following four characteristics: unimodal, multimodal, separable, and inseparable.

To address the problem of front-end cooperative navigation of multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles（UAVs）and multi-Unmanned Surface Vehicles（USVs）in a sea-air cooperation scenario，this paper conducts research on the multi-UAVs and multi-USVs formation cooperation mechanism based on the hierarchical leader-follower strategy. A motion model for cross-domain cluster formation is established to describe the leader-follower relationships among various entities within the cross-domain cluster system. Regarding the cooperative trajectory planning problem for the Leader-UAV and Leader-USV，a trajectory cost function considering multiple constraints is formulated based on the established double-layer grid map model. The improved genetic algorithm is employed for optimization. In the context of cross-domain cluster formation cooperative motion control，heterogeneous formation controllers for the leader-UAV and leader-USV and homogeneous formation motion controllers are designed based on the hierarchical leader-follower formation strategy. Parameter tuning is performed for the homogeneous formation motion controller using the fuzzy controller.

Multi-UAV MEC systems can meet the quality of service requirements for computation intensive applications of ground terminals (GTs) in complex field environments, emergency disaster relief and other special scenarios. In this paper, a multi-UAV cooperative computation framework is proposed while taking the GT movement and random arrival of computation tasks into consideration. A long-term optimization problem is formulated for the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and resource allocation, subject to minimizing the total GT computation task completion time and the total system energy consumption. To solve this problem, a joint multiple time-scale optimization algorithm is proposed. In particular, the optimization problem is decomposed into a long time-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning subproblem and a short time-scale resource allocation subproblem. The proximal policy optimization algorithm is invoked to solve the long time-scale subproblem. The greedy algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method are employed to solve the short time-scale subproblem. Finally, a joint multiple time-scale optimization algorithm with a two-layer loop structure is proposed. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed multi-UAV cooperative computation MEC system outperforms the conventional MEC system without collaboration among UAVs; and 2) the proposed algorithm can quickly adapt to different degrees of environmental dynamics and outperforms the benchmark algorithm for different network sizes, task requirements, and available resources. 0090-6778  © 2024 IEEE.","Deep reinforcement learning; mobile edge computing; multi-UAV cooperative computation; resource allocation; trajectory planning","Antennas; Approximation algorithms; Deep learning; Disaster prevention; Drones; Energy utilization; Job analysis; Mobile edge computing; Optimization; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Trajectories; Aerial vehicle; Cooperative computation; Deep reinforcement learning; Delay; Heuristics algorithm; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative computation; Optimisations; Reinforcement learnings; Resource management; Resources allocation; Task analysis; Trajectory Planning; Heuristic algorithms","T.

Our main motivation is to make small-sized UAVs with limited computing and sensing hardware capable of reliably performing the scanning task in cluttered environments.

We propose a Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) based approach for solving the trajectory optimization underpinning VACNA. In particular, our CEM projects sampled vehicle trajectories onto the constraint sets before evaluating the cost functions. We further learn a deep generative model in the form of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) from expert demonstrations to warm-start our optimizer. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we present a detailed analysis of the role of our proposed cost and constraint functions for cooperative occlusion-free navigation. Second, we compare our custom CEM optimizer with conventional variants and show significantly reduced collision and occlusion rates. Finally, our CVAE initialization allows our optimizer to operate with smaller batch sizes and achieve real-time performance even on embedded hardware devices like NVIDIA Jetson Xavier.  © 2023 IEEE.","Aerial systems: Applications; machine learning for robot control; optimization and optimal control","Air navigation; Antennas; Cost benefit analysis; Cost functions; Inventory control; Learning systems; Navigation systems; Robot programming; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Visibility; Aerial system: application; Aerial systems; Cooperative navigations; Cross-entropy method; Machine learning for robot control; Machine-learning; Optimization and optimal control; Robots control; System applications; Task analysis; Trajectories","H.

Following a detailed outline of the proposed approach, it is shown that a significant reduction of noise levels perceived by human workers at noise-sensitive locations is realized via a path planner which generates optimal paths ranging from quietest to shortest paths. The approach is then augmented with a path-correction mechanism which accounts for noise exposure duration to ensure the aforementioned optimal paths are compliant with a given industrial/environmental standard. The correction mechanism enforces an adjustment of subsets of the planned paths inside quiet zones designated around noise-sensitive locations. The presented concepts were verified using numerical simulations conducted for a 2-dimensional rasterized obstacle field followed by a statistical design of experiments. The proposed framework is highly versatile and integrable with widely used industrial path planners, rendering it a highly valuable tool for noisy collaborative workplaces. © The Author(s) 2022.","acoustics; noise control; path planning; sound exposure; unmanned aerial vehicle","Acoustic noise; Acoustic variables control; Antennas; Audition; Compliance control; Compliant mechanisms; Design of experiments; Machine design; Noise pollution; Robot programming; Adverse effect; Aerial vehicle; Collaborative environments; Correction mechanism; Human robots; Noise mitigation; Optimal paths; Path planners; Sound exposure; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Motion planning","M.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a cluster modeling method based on an undirected graph, which optimizes the entire model by adding constraints. A distributed system is also utilized to plan the entire cluster, improving the efficiency and robustness of the system and allowing individual drones to execute their flight tasks independently.

To enhance the adaptability of UAV applications, it is required that they possess fast path-planning capabilities. This article takes the execution of complex tasks by multiple UAVs in a 3-D environment as background and transforms the path-planning problem into a multiconstraint optimization problem. Innovatively combining the hunter-prey optimizer (HPO) algorithm and task allocation mechanism, this study achieves collaborative path planning for multiple UAVs for complex tasks. In order to improve the optimization speed of the HPO algorithm, the following improvements have been made: first, introducing the chaotic mapping model to improve the performance of population initialization; second, adopting the golden sine strategy to change the population update strategy and accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Then, the single-peak and multipeak benchmark functions are used to test the average, standard deviation, and optimal values of the algorithm. Finally, path planning experiments are carried out in a 3-D map with multiple task points and obstacles, and the results show that the adapt golden sine HOP (AGSHPO) algorithm improves the robustness and real-time performance of the UAVs when executing complex tasks to a certain extent.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Hunter prey optimizer (HPO); multitasking; optimization problem; path planning; task assignment","Constrained optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Complex task; Fastest paths; HPO; Multi tasks; Multiple UAVs; Optimization problems; Path planning method; Planning capability; Task environment; Tasks assignments; Motion planning","S.S.

This paper proposes a hybrid cluster access selection algorithm for transmission line (QS) assurance of electric power business based on analyzing the differentiated needs of the electric power business. The entropy power method calculates objective weights for transmission line inspection, and the game theory is used to fuse the subjective and objective weights to determine the comprehensive weights. Secondly, the cooperative control rate is designed for the power inspection UAV cluster, and a set of cooperative control management systems for the power inspection UAV cluster is designed and implemented through detailed requirement analysis.

However, the existing control methods rarely focus on the optimization of UAV formation based on constrained effectiveness, and faster tracking performance is required in formation control. Therefore, this study presents a 6 degrees-of-freedom UAV formation control architecture that integrates trajectory planning and attitude control by considering the constrained effectiveness of optimal formation and coupling effect. To achieve formation selection and geometry parameter optimization in a battlefield environment, a formation-constrained effectiveness model based on battlefield effectiveness was proposed, and the formation was optimized using the simulated annealing particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) method. To verify the accuracy and effectiveness of formation optimization and control, five UAV formation flight scenarios based on combat effectiveness formation were designed. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed optimization algorithm can maximizes battlefield effectiveness based on the formation-constrained effectiveness model; the proposed trajectory planning accurately tracked the relative position commands with a fast response time and short rising time; the proposed coupling effect-involved attitude control method was compared with the conventional attitude control method to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method; and the controller considering coupling had a faster trajectory response in the coupling effect zone. These results suggest that the proposed approach has a better tracking performance and demonstrates high efficiency and accuracy in UAV formation control. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Coupling effect; Formation constrained effectiveness model; Formation optimization and control; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation","Aircraft control; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Constrained optimization; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Efficiency; Numerical methods; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Simulated annealing; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Control methods; Coupling effect; Effectiveness models; Formation constrained effectiveness model; Formation control; Formation optimization; Optimization and control; Unmanned aerial vehicle  formation; Vehicle formations; Attitude control","H.

This paper addresses the problem of multi-UAV cooperative sensing and coverage of a flood-struck region to identify serviceable paths to critical locations for waterborne vehicles (WBV) in real time. A serviceable path is defined as a location that is obstacle free and has adequate water level for possible movement of WBVs. We develop a deep reinforcement learning model to learn a cooperative multi-UAV policy for real-time coverage of a flooded region. The coverage information gathered by the UAVs captures the presence of obstacles present in the path connecting the start and target/critical locations given by the shortest Manhattan distance. This coverage information is utilized by the path planning algorithm, i.e., MEA∗, to minimize the number of expansion nodes and identify a serviceable path quickly. To conserve energy, UAVs initially follow a guided path to explore the optimal route. If obstacles are encountered, the UAVs search nearby areas for an alternate path to reach the critical location(s). The proposed approach, MEA∗MADDPG, is compared with other prevalent techniques from the literature over real-world inspired simulated flood environments. The results highlight the significance of the proposed model as it outperforms other techniques when compared over various performance metrics.  © 2023 ACM.","Deep Reinforcement Learning; Disaster Management; Real-Time Path Planning; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","Air navigation; Antennas; Deep learning; Disaster prevention; Drones; Emergency services; Location; Motion planning; Real time systems; Reinforcement learning; Robot programming; Water levels; Aerial vehicle; Autonomous navigation; Critical location; Deep reinforcement learning; Disaster management; Real time path planning; Real- time; Reinforcement learnings; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle navigation; Floods","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","978-145039980-7","","","English","ACM Int.

The proposed algorithm comprehensively considers a variety of complex constraints involved in actual application scenarios and constructs a UAV formation mission planning model with minimum task execution cost and path planning cost as the optimization goal.

Although there have been a large number of studies on UAV coverage path planning, there are still some problems in the cooperative work of multi-UAV in complex environments under the constraints of energy consumption and work efficiency requirements of UAV. To solve unnecessary energy loss when multiple UAVs jointly execute complex area coverage tasks and improve the overall work efficiency of the UAV swarm. In this study, we simulated the situation of multiple UAVs performing the mission of area coverage under the constraints of the corresponding energy consumption in a work environment with no-fly zones. We propose the use of multiple UAV base stations to provide takeoff and landing services for UAVs that perform missions. We proposed two algorithms. One is the multi-base station multi-UAV cooperative coverage path planning algorithm with flexible obstacle avoidance ability (MBS-MUCCPPAFOA), which performs coverage route planning from an entire area using multiple base stations to perform multi-UAV area coverage tasks. The other algorithm is a multi-UAV cooperative coverage path planning algorithm with flexible obstacle avoidance capability based on area segmentation (MUAV-CCPPAFOA-AS), which divides the entire work area and performs coverage path planning for each sub-area to perform multi-UAV area coverage tasks. We compared the proposed algorithm with the common scanning coverage path planning algorithm, and proved the robustness of the proposed MBS-MUCCPPAFOA and MUAV-CCPPAFOA-AS algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.","Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle teams; coverage path planning problems; CPP; MTSP; multiple traveling salesmen problems; path planning; predictive task assignment; task allocation; UAV; unmanned aerial vehicles","Antennas; Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Job analysis; Traveling salesman problem; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle team; Coverage path planning; Coverage path planning problem; CPP; MTSP; Multiple travelling salesmen problem; Path planning problems; Predictive models; Predictive task assignment; Search problem; Task allocation; Task analysis; Tasks assignments; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Motion planning","S.

Secondly, the cost function is formulated, and the constraints for ensuring the safe and smooth inspection of UAVs are proposed to transform path planning into an optimization problem. Finally, a hybrid algorithm of SPSO and DE algorithms based on the Nash bargaining theory is proposed by introducing a cooperative game model for optimizing the cost function to plan the optimal path of UAV inspection in complex urban pipe corridors. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm (GSPSODE), the SPSO, DE, genetic algorithm (GA), and ant colony optimization (ACO) are compared with GSPSODE, and the results show that GSPSODE is superior to other methods in UAV inspection path planning.

This paper investigates the online data collection problem for MCS over an edge-assisted UAV network architecture, where UAVs work to collect the data required by tasks at different on-ground point-of-interests (PoIs) in an autonomous and cooperative manner. Different from conventional edge-assisted UAV networks, edge nodes in our paper help distribute, aggregate, share, and update the task state information (TSI, e.g., if a task has been completed, or if it still requires more data), to support efficient and cost-effective data collection, e.g., avoiding repetitive and ineffective task execution. In particular, a UAV can exchange TSI with an edge node when it is within the signal coverage of the edge node, while making decisions on PoI selection and path planning in an online and decentralized manner. To address the issue of edge-assisted UAV data collection, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm using personalized training with decentralized executing (PTDE) architecture. Different from the traditional centralized training with decentralized executing (CTDE) architecture, our considered architecture adopts the agent-specific state for critic networks instead of the joint observation, thus achieving effective utilization of environmental information. Furthermore, we propose an observation enhancement algorithm based on artificial potential field (APF). Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm greatly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of total profit, data collection ratio, geographical fairness, and energy efficiency.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Decentralized and autonomous data collection; mobile crowdsensing; mobile edge computing; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; task state information sharing","Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Data acquisition; Data handling; Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Information analysis; Job analysis; Learning algorithms; Mobile edge computing; Motion planning; Multi agent systems; Network architecture; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Crowdsensing; Data collection; Decentralised; Decentralized and autonomous data collection; Heuristics algorithm; Information sharing; Mobile crowdsensing; Multi agent; Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; State information; Task analysis; Task state; Task state information sharing; Heuristic algorithms","W.

Intelligent agricultural machinery is capable of autonomous driving and remote control, but due to its limited perception of farmland and field obstacles, the assistance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is required. Although existing intelligent systems have greater advantages than traditional agricultural machinery in improving the quality of operations and reducing labor costs, they also produce complex operational planning problems. Especially as agricultural products and fields become more diversified, it is necessary to develop an adaptive operation planning method that takes into account the efficiency and quality of work. However, the existing operation planning methods lack practicality and do not guarantee global optimization because traditional planners only consider the path commands and generate the path in the rectangular field without considering other factors. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel and practical collaborative path planning method for intelligent agricultural machinery based on unmanned aerial vehicles. First, we utilize UAVs for obstacle detection. With the field information and operation data preprocessed, automatic agricultural machinery could be assisted in avoiding obstacles in the field. Second, by considering both the historical state of the current operation and the statistics from previous operations, the real-time control of agricultural machinery is determined. Therefore, the K-means algorithm is used to extract key control parameters and discretize the state space of agricultural machinery. Finally, the dynamic operation plan is established based on the Markov chain. This plan can estimate the probability of agricultural machinery transitioning from one state to another by analyzing data, thereby dynamically determining real-time control strategies. The field test with an automatic tractor shows that the operation planner can achieve higher performance than the other two popular methods. © 2023 by the authors.","agricultural machinery; autonomous operation; Markov chain; UAVs","","X.

One of the main problems for plant protection quadcopters is completing planning tasks efficiently and quickly. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous task assignment and decision-making method for coverage path planning by multiple cooperative quadcopters. The Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method is adopted to acquire the optimal solution for the proposed problem. Then, a simulation platform by MATLAB Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) is established using the Stateflow technique, and multiple ZY-UAV-680 quadrotor UAVs are employed to carry out the actual flight tests. Finally, simulations and actual flight tests are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the autonomous optimal task assignment and decision-making method. The final results show that: the proposed method can divide multiple UAVs reasonably to several blocks; the time differences between the simulation test and real flight test are only 39.8 sec and 20.6 sec, and accounts for 6.6% and 3.9% of the spraying time spent on real flight test by three cooperative quadrotors, respectively; the optimal scheme can save 60.8 sec and 80.0 sec in the simulation tests and the real flight tests, which accounts for 10.8% and 13.2% of the time spent on average scheme, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the simulation results can match the real flight test results quite well regardless of average scheme or optimal scheme, and the optimal scheme is more efficient and timesaving than the average scheme. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Coverage Path Planning (CPP); Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs); Pesticide spraying; Pixhawk Autopilot; Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP); Stateflow; Task assignment","Antennas; Decision making; Flight simulators; MATLAB; Motion planning; Quadratic programming; Seed; Simulation platform; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Coverage path planning; Flight test; Graphical user interface; Pesticide spraying; Pixhawk autopilot; Sequential quadratic programming; STATEFLOW; Tasks assignments; agricultural application; agricultural technology; decision making; pesticide application; simulation; spray; unmanned vehicle; Graphical user interfaces","B.

However, planning feasible paths becomes challenging due to constraints imposed by complex environments and the inherent maneuverability of UAVs, particularly in large-scale scenarios involving multiple UAVs ( multi-UAV). This paper addresses the multi-UAV cooperative path planning problem, formulating it as a constrained optimization problem and proposing the evolutionary state estimation-based multi-strategy jellyfish search (ESE-MSJS) algorithm to search for high-quality paths. In the proposed algorithm, a switching framework based on evolutionary state estimation is constructed to prevent ineffective searches and enhance suitability for path planning. Within this framework, three distinct update modes are developed for each individual, enabling a more efficient and flexible selection of appropriate learning strategies. In addition, a neighborhood topology-based elite example learning strategy is employed to increase population diversity, and a best information guiding-driven adaptive scaling factor strategy exploits the surrounding space, strengthening local search capabilities. The Gaussian barebone mechanism is introduced to balance exploration and exploitation. To effectively cope with intricate constraints, a dynamic <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\alpha$</tex-math></inline-formula>-level comparison strategy is incorporated into the individual update stage of the ESE-MSJS.

A multi-UAVs 3D cooperative curve path hierarchical planning model based on single UAV planning layer—path smoothing layer—multiple UAVs cooperative planning layer is established with the idea of hierarchical planning to transform the complex constrained planning problems into the sub-functional optimization solution problems to reduce the computational effort. Considering the performance limitations of genetic algorithm (GA) in solving high-dimensional complex constrained optimization problems, Tent chaotic mapping is used to uniformly initialize the population in order to expand the individual search space and enrich the population diversity. On this basis, the adaptive genetic operators are introduced to balance the global search and local exploitation capability of the algorithm, so as to help individuals jump out of the local optimum. Then, the fitness dynamic update strategy is adopted to further improve the local exploration ability and convergence speed of the algorithm. The elite retention strategy is introduced into the GA to better ensure the global convergence of the improved algorithm. CEA-GA is used to solve the proposed model, and the simulation results show that CEA-GA has strong robustness, good search performance and convergence efficiency, and can plan the cooperative curve path to satisfy the constraints for the swarms, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method and the superiority of CEA-GA. © 2023 Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA).

Nevertheless, state-of-the-art schemes based on deterministic optimizations or single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) cannot reduce the backlog of task bits and simultaneously improve energy efficiency in highly dynamic network environments, where the design problem amounts to a sequential decision-making problem. In order to address the aforementioned problems, as well as the curses of dimensionality introduced by the growing number of terrestrial terrestrial users, this paper proposes a distributed multi-objective (MO) dynamic trajectory planning and offloading scheduling scheme, integrated with MORL and the kernel method. The design of n-step return is also applied to average fluctuations in the backlog. Numerical results reveal that the n-step return can benefit the proposed kernel-based approach, achieving significant improvement in the long-term average backlog performance, compared to the conventional 1-step return design. Due to such design and the kernel-based neural network, to which decision-making features can be continuously added, the kernel-based approach can outperform the approach based on fully-connected deep neural network, yielding improvement in energy consumption and the backlog performance, as well as a significant reduction in decision-making and online learning time. ©1967-2012 IEEE.","mobile edge computing; multi-objective reinforcement learning; offloading scheduling; trajectory planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Deep neural networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Job analysis; Mobile edge computing; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Decisions makings; Dynamic scheduling; Multi objective; Multi-objective reinforcement learning; Offloading scheduling; Processor scheduling; Reinforcement learnings; Task analysis; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Decision making","Y.

Drones, with their wide field of view and ability to vertically displace, offer a potential solution to compensate for the limited field of view of ground vehicles. However, the conventional approach of path extraction solely provides pixel-level positional information. Consequently, when drones guide ground unmanned vehicles using visual cues, the road fitting accuracy is compromised, resulting in reduced speed. Addressing these limitations with existing methods has proven to be a formidable task. In this study, we propose an innovative approach for guiding the visual movement of unmanned ground vehicles using an air–ground collaborative vectorized curved road representation and trajectory planning method. Our method offers several advantages over traditional road fitting techniques. Firstly, it incorporates a road star points ordering method based on the K-Means clustering algorithm, which simplifies the complex process of road fitting. Additionally, we introduce a road vectorization model based on the piecewise GA-Bézier algorithm, enabling the identification of the optimal frame from the initial frame to the current frame in the video stream. This significantly improves the road fitting effect ((Formula presented.)) and reduces the model running time (T— (Formula presented.)). Furthermore, we employ smooth trajectory planning along the “route-plane” to maximize speed at turning points, thereby minimizing travel time (T— (Formula presented.)). To validate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed method, we conducted extensive simulation experiments and performed actual comparison experiments. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. © 2023 by the authors.","GA-Bézie algorithm; route-plane; trajectory planning; vectorized curvedroad representation","Antennas; Drones; Genetic algorithms; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; K-means clustering; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Trajectories; Travel time; Conventional approach; Displacers; GA-bezie algorithm; Mountainous terrain; Route-plane; Trajectory Planning; Vectorized curvedroad representation; Vehicle trajectories; Wide field-ofview; article; k means clustering; running; simulation; travel; unmanned aerial vehicle; velocity; videorecording; Efficiency","H.

To solve the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem, a multi-mechanism collaborative improved grey wolf optimization algorithm (NAS-GWO) is proposed. In NAS-GWO, the evolutionary boundary constraint processing mechanism is introduced to update the position of the grey wolf individuals that cross the boundary in time to retain the position information of the optimal individuals to the largest degree to enhance the search accuracy of the algorithm. Then, the Gaussian mutation strategy and spiral function are used as perturbation mechanisms to help the algorithm jump out of the local optimum in time to strengthen the exploitation capability of NAS-GWO. Meanwhile, the improved Sigmoid function is used as a nonlinear convergence factor for balancing the exploitation and exploration of the NAS-GWO. By comparing NAS-GWO with ten advanced metaheuristic algorithms on 20 CEC2017 benchmark functions, the experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm has superior merit seeking and robustness. Moreover, the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem is solved using NAS-GWO. The experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm plans a more viable and stable trajectory path in four different scale missions, while the most important is that it requires less cost. Among them, the algorithm reduces 27.93%, 38.15%, 32.32%, 34.11%, 10.63%, and 13.48% on average in cost function values compared to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Aquila Optimizer (AO), Differential Evolution (DE), Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), and Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO), thus proving the effectiveness and significance of NAS-GWO in the agricultural UAV trajectory path planning problem. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural UAV; Grey Wolf optimization algorithm; Multiple mechanisms; Trajectory planning","Agriculture; Antennas; Motion planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Agricultural unmanned aerial vehicle; Gray wolf optimization algorithm; Gray wolves; Multi mechanisms; Multiple mechanism; Optimization algorithms; Planning problem; Trajectory Planning; Vehicle trajectories; Cost functions","P.

Whereas, most of the existing logistics UAV delivery models have not taken the energy consumption of the logistics UAVs and mixed time windows of the customers, which leads to their models cannot be applied in practical transportation systems. Therefore, we propose to minimize the total energy cost of multiple logistics UAVs during the customized products delivery period for a smart transportation system. Taking the energy consumption variation of the logistics UAVs, mixed time windows of the customers, as well as simultaneous delivery and pick up into consideration, we formulate a cooperative path planning problem via jointly optimizing the route of the logistics UAVs and the service allocation. To solve this large-scale integer programming problem, we employ the Large Neighborhood Search Algorithm (LNS) to accelerate the convergence rate of Genetic Algorithm (GA), and then develop an improved GA based cooperative path planning algorithm (IGCPA). The optimization procedure of the proposed algorithm IGCPA is divided into two phases, using the GA crossover operator and variational operator in the global search phase and LNS operator in the local search phase, and validating the integer programming model and the effectiveness of the solution algorithm based on different scale cases. Finally, abundant simulation results show that the energy cost of IGCPA is reduced by 17.35%, 15.18% and 9.99% compared with GA, LNS and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), respectively. Furthermore, the IGCPA is validated using Solomn standard data, which further verifies that the IGCPA can enhance the convergence rate of GA as well as obtain a lower delivery cost. Sensitivity analysis of the maximum UAV load and battery capacity reveals that the distribution cost tends to decrease and then increase as the increase of maximum load and battery capacity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","AI-based logistics UAV; Energy consumption; Hybrid time window; Intelligent transportation systems; Path planning","Antennas; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Artificial intelligence-based logistic unmanned aerial vehicle; Cooperative path planning; Energy-consumption; Hybrid time window; Intelligent transportation systems; Large neighbourhood searches; Neighborhood search algorithms; Path-planning algorithm; Time windows; Motion planning","S.

However, their range of view is often limited by movable obstacles or barriers, resulting in inefficient path generation. Here, we present the aerial online mapping system to generate an efficient path for a UGV on a two-dimensional map. The map is updated by projecting obstacles detected in the aerial images taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle through an object detector based on a conventional convolutional neural network. The proposed system is implemented in real-time by a skid steering ground vehicle and a quadcopter with relatively small, low-cost embedded systems. The frameworks and each module of the systems are given in detail to evaluate the performance. The system is also demonstrated in unstructured outdoor environments such as in a football field and a park with unreliable communication links. The results show that the aerial online mapping is effective in path generation for autonomous UGVs in real environments. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","autonomous vehicles; cooperative systems; mobile robots; multirobot systems; object detection; path planning; sensor fusion; terrain mapping","Antennas; Autonomous vehicles; Embedded systems; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Mapping; Mobile robots; Neural networks; Object detection; Object recognition; Online systems; Optical radar; Real time systems; Robot programming; Autonomous Vehicles; Cooperative systems; Multi-robot systems; Objects detection; Online mapping; Outdoor environment; Path-generation; Real- time; Sensor fusion; Terrain mapping; Motion planning","J.

In the aftermath of disasters, cobots can cooperate with humans to mitigate risks and increase the possibility of rescuing people in distress. This study examines the resilient and dynamic synergy between a swarm of snake robots, first responders and people to be rescued. The possibility of delivering first aid to potential victims dispersed around a disaster environment is implemented. In the HRC simulation framework presented in this study, the first responder initially deploys a UAV, swarm of snake robots and emergency items. The UAV provides the first responder with the site planimetry, which includes the layout of the area, as well as the precise locations of the individuals in need of rescue and the aiding goods to be delivered. Each individual snake robot in the swarm is then assigned a victim. Subsequently an optimal path is determined by each snake robot using the A* algorithm, to approach and reach its respective target while avoiding obstacles. By using their prehensile capabilities, each snake robot adeptly grasps the aiding object to be dispatched. The snake robots successively arrive at the delivering location near the victim, following their optimal paths, and proceed to release the items. To demonstrate the potential of the framework, several case studies are outlined concerning the execution of operations that combine locomotion, obstacle avoidance, grasping and deploying. The Coppelia-Sim Robotic Simulator is utilised for this framework. The analysis of the motion of the snake robots on the path show highly accurate movement with and without the emergency item. This study is a step towards a holistic semi-autonomous search and rescue operation.

With this algorithm, the Q-table is obtained and used to calculate the shortest path of each UAV and the cooperative range. Then the time-coordinated paths is obtained by adjusting the action selection strategy of the circumventing UAVs. Considering the collision avoidance problem of multiple UAVs, the partical replanning area is determined by designing retreat parameters, and based on the deep reinforcement learning theory, the neural network is used to replace Q-table to re-plan the partical path for UAVs, which can avoid the problem of dimensional explosion. As for the previously unexplored obstacles, the obstacle matrix is designed based on the idea of the artificial potential field theory, which is then superimposed on the original Q-table to realize collision avoidance for the unexplored obstacle. The simulation results verify that with the proposed reinforcement learning path planning method, the coordinated paths with time coordination and collision avoidance can be obtained, and the previously unexplored obstacles in the simulation can be avoided as well.

However, few studies were conducted on the coverage problem in amphibious environments, which is particularly challenging and urgent. In this case, we propose a collaborative coverage strategy to achieve amphibious regional coverage. Our approach is based on the following parts. Firstly, a centralized area allocation strategy is used to allocate subregion coverage tasks to each agent. Secondly, a distributed path planning algorithm is used to plan the coverage of each UAV in the amphibious environment to minimize the energy loss of the UAVs. This strategy incorporates the importance of the region and the ability of the agent, which shows great adaptability to the amphibious environment. Finally, the proposed strategy is compared with several previous popular methods in the simulations to verify its effective performance.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Motion planning; Allocation strategy; Centralised; Coverage problem; Coverage strategies; Effective performance; Monitoring tasks; Path-planning algorithm; Searching task; Energy dissipation","Y.

To address the issue of insufficient freshness of information during the offloading process for latency-sensitive computing tasks, we propose a hybrid strategy-based multi-agent collaborative algorithm (HSMAC). Minimizing the average age of information (AoI) in the system is set as the optimization objective and solved within the actor-critic framework. By integrating local observations from various data sources, edge buffering, and offloading conditions, the algorithm learns UAV trajectory planning and data scheduling. Additionally, a novel federated learning algorithm (FL) is introduced to enable multiple agents to share experiences.

For example, a swarm of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) enables the collaborative sensing of bulky loads for transportation over impassable terrains when the load weighs several times more than each UAV. In this work, we propose a hierarchical algorithmic architecture that supports the search and coverage of various unknown payload profiles for subsequent transportation. The grasping formation of UAVs over the payload emerges from the synthetic behaviours in the architecture without any path planning. Experiments show that our proposed design can be successfully applied in searching and coverage of various loads and has been validated in the real world through the use of Crazyflie micro-UAVs.

While the majority of works in literature use UAVs as aerial base stations or as relays, this paper proposes to use UAVs as both relays and aerial base stations. Furthermore, this is one of the few works where UAVs are used as both static base stations (cluster UAVs) and mobile base stations (relay UAVs). The proposed 3-D deployment and trajectory planning algorithm is implemented at the ground base station (GBS) and the resultant parameters will be distributed to cluster UAVs either directly or through relay UAVs. A four-step approach is proposed to solve the 2-D location coordinates of cluster UAVs, to find the location of the GBS, the power-height optimization of cluster UAVs, and to optimize the trajectory of relay UAVs. The number of users served, channel capacity achieved, power saved due to optimal deployment, latency reduced, and power saving by optimal trajectory are some of the performance metrics used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The simulation results are validated to show that the proposed solutions outperform existing similar approaches.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","3-D deployment; cooperative communication; graph theory; relay UAV; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)","Antennas; Base stations; Cooperative communication; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 3-D deployment; Aerial vehicle; Deployment planning; Optimal trajectories; Power; Relay unmanned aerial vehicle; Relay-based; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Graph theory","N.L.

The multi-UAV system design is a wealth of research points under the flight planning umbrella, including the design of communication protocols for the Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) connecting UAVs, and the inevitable flight design aspects which are the mission planning and path planning. With the fact that topology and routing are the communication design parts most affected by FANET's highly dynamic 3D movement, this paper introduces a design concept for multi-UAV system flight plan that has been named mission-based PTR triangle to indicate the importance of joint optimization of the three design pillars: Path planning, Topology control, and Routing strategy based on mission requirements. These aspects are very interconnected; they determine the UAV positions and relative placement and how the UAVs are connected; any of them can influence or be influenced by the other. They can be regarded as a single process and the trade-off between their parameters controls their influence. In addition, most of the flight planning operations are confined to a PTR triangle its edges represent cross-layer or joint optimization associations, results in different optimization cases to support adaptive optimality suitable to the dynamic nature of FANET, design constraints, and variety in mission scenarios. To this end, this paper sheds light on and reviews the work done on each process and on the mission analysis, including classifications, approaches, and examples of separate and cross-layered optimization. The paper drew a roadmap for flight planning employing the mission-based PTR triangle design approach with a proof-of-concept to the PTR joint optimization ideas. The paper serves as an entry point to the interested researchers in the field of UAV systems design. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Drone; FANET; Path planning; Routing; Topology; UAV","Ad hoc networks; Antennas; Economic and social effects; Motion planning; Systems analysis; Topology; Ad-hoc networks; Aerial vehicle; Cooperative systems; Flight planning; Flying ad-hoc network; Joint optimization; Routings; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; Vehicle domain; Drones","B.M.

To efficiently capture high-quality images of power equipment, we propose a method for automatically generating joint inspection points for multiple intelligent equipment. It introduces a shooting potential model and a spatial relationship model to assess the suitability of shooting power equipment at different spatial points using various intelligent equipment. A point selection method is designed based on shooting quality constraints and spatial constraints to optimize inspection efficiency. The focus is on generating non-redundant and complete inspection points that are suitable for multiple intelligent equipment to perform with. Additionally, we study cooperative path planning of the heterogeneous robot systems to reduce the time required for the inspection task. An improved Ant-Lion Optimization Algorithm is proposed to decouple the routes of mobile robots and UAVs and plan their routes simultaneously.

To deal with the space and time conflicts of multi-UAVs in complex environments, a multi-collision-based multi-UAV cooperative path planning algorithm, multi-conflict-based search (MCBS), is proposed. First, the flight and cooperative constraints of UAV are analyzed, and a three-dimensional environment model is established that incorporates geographical information. Then, hierarchical optimization is used to design collaborative algorithms. In the low-level path design, UAV flight constraints are combined with a sparse A* algorithm, and by improving the cost function, the search space is reduced, and the search time is shortened. In high-level cooperation, the priorities of different conflicts are set, heuristic information is introduced to guide the constraint tree to grow in the direction of satisfying the constraints, and the optimal path set is searched by the best priority search algorithm to reduce the convergence time. Finally, the planning results of the proposed algorithm, the traditional CBS algorithm, and the sparse A* algorithm for different UAV tasks are compared, and the influence of the optimization parameters on the calculation results is discussed. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can solve cooperative conflict between UAVs, improve the efficiency of path searches, and quickly find the optimal safe cooperative path that satisfies flight and cooperative constraints. © 2023 by the authors.","conflict-based search; multi-UAV cooperative; path planning; sparse A*","Flight paths; Flight simulators; Geographic information systems; Heuristic algorithms; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); A* algorithm; Complex environments; Conflict-based search; Cooperative path planning; Multi collisions; Multi UAV; Multi-UAV cooperative; Optimal algorithm; Space and time; Sparse A*; Trees (mathematics)","X.

UAVs have the characteristics of flexibility, but they usually have limited endurance. Ground robots can bear large loads and are suitable for use as landing platforms and mobile replenishment stations for UAVs, but their movement is constrained by the road network. This paper studies the cooperative path planning of the heterogeneous robot systems. In order to reduce the time cost of the task, this paper proposes a two-step strategy combining ant colony optimization (ACO) and genetic algorithm (GA) to decouple the routes of mobile robot and UAV, and plans the routes of mobile robot and UAV at the same time. In the first step, ant colony optimization is used to search for feasible routes of the mobile robot. In the second step, we derive the model of the UAV＇s optimal path and use the genetic algorithm to solve it. The UAV path length is returned to the first step to update the pheromone in the road network. Then, we realize the overall optimization of the heterogeneous collaborative system path. In order to further reduce the flight time cost of UAVs, this paper also studies the problem of cooperative path planning for UAVs to continuously complete multiple tasks within their endurance capabilities.

Taking the balance of short-term benefits, long-term benefits and coordination benefits of UAV search as the core, considering the characteristics of the three-dimensional motion of a UAV, a mathematical programming model for multi-UAV cooperative search is constructed, and a search information map is designed with four factors of existence probability, environmental uncertainty, revisiting pheromone and searching gain.

In this paper, a multi-UAV mission simulation system is designed to show the greatest advantage of its collaborative mission planning results simulated and tested in 3D scenarios. It simultaneously reflects and records changes in UAV position, velocity, status, and other state values. The simulation program can be directly applied to real flight with only a few settings. First, the general system framework is presented. Second, according to the simulation requirements, the key modules involved in the software in the loop are given. Finally, through a path planning test for two UAVs, the effect of the system is demonstrated. The results show that the simulation verification based on the system is consistent with the real flight results in terms of functional implementation.

Due to the stringent coordination requirements and constraints, multi-UAV path planning in three-dimensional complex environments is more challenging. To solve this problem, A collaborative method for planning multiple UAVs paths in complex environments is proposed. The SMA algorithm is improved in terms of the initial position of the population, the feedback factor and the individual position update method, which improves the convergence speed and convergence accuracy as well as the robustness of the algorithm. Simulation results in complex cases show that the proposed algorithm can obtain effective paths in multi-UAV collaborative path planning, and the overall performance is improved by 9.5% compared to the SMA algorithm.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Antennas; Coordination reactions; Military applications; Military vehicles; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Complex environments; Control technologies; Cooperative path planning; Feedback factors; Multi UAV; Multiple UAVs; Slime moulds; Stringents; Vehicle path planning; Motion planning","A.H.

Previous works in engineering problem solving have studied the effectiveness of teams and individuals, showing that in some circumstances, individuals can outperform collaborative teams working on the same task. The current work extends these insights to novel team configurations in virtual, interdisciplinary teams. In these team configurations, the whole meta-team can interact, but the sub-teams within them may or may not. Here, team performance and process are studied within the context of a complex drone design and path-planning problem. Via a collaborative research platform called HyForm, communication and behavioral patterns can be tracked and analyzed throughout problem solving. This work shows that nominally inspired sub-structured teams, where members work independently, outperform interacting sub-structured teams. While problem-solving actions remain consistent, communication patterns significantly differ, with nominally inspired sub-structured teams communicating significantly less. Questionnaires reveal that the manager roles in the nominally inspired sub-structured teams, which are more central in communication and information flow, experience a greater cognitive and workload burden than their counterparts in the interacting sub-structured teams. Moreover, members in the nominally inspired sub-structured teams experience their teams as inferior on various dimensions, including communication and feedback effectiveness, yet their performance is superior. Overall, this work adds to the literature on nominal versus interacting problem-solving teams, extending the finding to larger, interdisciplinary teams.  © 2023 by ASME.","collaborative design; design teams; multidisciplinary design and optimization","Aircraft communication; Design for manufacturability; Integrated circuit design; Collaborative design; Communication pattern; Design tasks; Design team; Engineering design; Engineering industries; Interdisciplinary teams; Multidisciplinary design and optimization; Problem-solving; Team configuration; Behavioral research","J.T.

However, in the face of diverse tasks and complex environment, the traditional task allocation and planning methods are limited. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-UAV cooperative task assignment and planning model based on fuzzy clustering algorithm. Through fuzzy clustering algorithm, we can deal with the uncertainty and diversity of tasks more flexibly and improve the intelligence and adaptability of the system. In the task assignment stage of the model, fuzzy clustering algorithm is introduced to identify the similarity between tasks, thus forming fuzzy task groups. The task assignment probability is determined by the membership degree of task and cluster, and the most suitable UAV is found for each task. In the path planning stage, the model uses the clustering results for intelligent path planning, fully considers the relationship between tasks, and optimizes the route of UAV. Through simulation experiments, we verify the excellent performance of the model in task allocation accuracy and system performance. The model based on fuzzy clustering shows better adaptability in the face of different task types and environmental changes. This research provides a new idea for the intelligence of multi-UAV cooperative operation, and has important guiding significance for the performance improvement of UAV system in the future. © 2023 IEEE.","cooperative operation; fuzzy clustering; multi-UAV; planning; Task assignment","Clustering algorithms; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cooperative operation; Fuzzy clustering algorithm; Model-based OPC; Multi UAV; Performance; Planning models; Task allocation; Task assignment models; Task planning; Tasks assignments; Fuzzy clustering","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835037527-5","","","English","Proc. - Int.

The collision avoidance and coordination between multiple unmanned aerial vehicles is a global optimal issue. This research addresses the path planning of multi-colonies with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles in dynamic environment. To observe the model of whole scenario, we combine maximum–minimum ant colony optimization and differential evolution to make metaheuristic optimization algorithm. Our designed algorithm, controls the deficiencies of present classical ant colony optimization and maximum–minimum ant colony optimization, has the contradiction among the excessive information and global optimization. Moreover, in our proposed algorithm, maximum–minimum ant colony optimization is used to lemmatize the pheromone and only best ant of each colony is able to construct the path. However, the path escape by maximum–minimum ant colony optimization and it treated as the object for differential evolution constraints. Now, it is ensuring to find the best global colony, which provides optimal solution for the entire colony. Furthermore, the proposed approach has an ability to increase the robustness while preserving the global convergence speed.

The UAV cluster can collaborate by communicating through inter-aircraft links and can quickly and accurately perform complex tasks such as path planning, collaborative reconnaissance, collaborative sensing and attack. In the process of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) cooperative operation, obtaining the real-time attitude information of each UAV is preliminary to implement collaborative cooperation. However, in practice, due to the internal malfunction of sensors and mutual interference among UAVs, the acquired attitudes often suffer from data missing. This paper proposed a novel missing data reconstruction method for UAV's attitude in the case of sensor failures. The attitude data of UAV is obtained through an advanced UAV simulation platform AirSim. Through fusing the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), a deep regression framework is established for missing data construction. In addition, we evaluate the reliability of the proposed method by comparing with different baseline models and different combinations of data missing. The performance of our method is quantified using metrics of root-mean-square-error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), determination coefficient (DC), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) score. The averaged performance values of our proposed method outperform other baseline algorithms. The results of the experiment show that the study could well-address the issue of missing data reconstruction and provide reliable attitude data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Long short-term memory; Missing data reconstruction; Temporal convolutional network; Time series; UAV","Antennas; Brain; Convolution; Errors; Mean square error; Motion planning; Regression analysis; Simulation platform; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Convolutional networks; Data missing; Data reconstruction; Missing data; Missing data reconstruction; Sensors' failures; Temporal convolutional network; Times series; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Long short-term memory","X.

However, the traditional way has some problems such as fixed power lines and single inspection target. And because of the independence of power transmission, transformation and distribution departments, the total demand for UAV and UAV controllers is large, and it is difficult to realize the integration of equipment, personnel and technology. In order to further improve the level of lean management, maintenance efficiency of the whole system of transmission, transformation and distribution, and realize scheduling UAV inspection tasks autonomously, this paper establishes a mathematical model based on the genetic algorithm, taking the UAV inspection route planning as the core problem, and taking the shortest total route as the objective function, and iteratively calculates the collected data through the genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal solution, which is finally concluded by analysis and conclusion. By using this model algorithm to plan the route of multi-professional UAV inspection, the total route of UAV inspection has been dramatically reduced, human resources have been reasonably allocated, and the power line inspection has become comprehensive and efficient. Regarding the emergency response speed of UAV inspection, this study selects the nearest nest response to make the nests interact with each other. The hangars that intersect within the coverage can be intelligently coordinated through the task priority to achieve the fastest and most appropriate automatic execution of UAV tasks and effectively improve emergency response efficiency. © 2023 SPIE.

To obtain the best benefit of the problem, this paper establishes a task allocation model that matches the battlefield environment. And the path planning between UAV and target is completed simultaneously. The real flight distance is used to replace the straight-line distance to realize the tight coupling of task allocation and path planning. A modified marine predator algorithm is proposed firstly in this paper to better solve the task allocation model. The exploitation and exploration ability of the algorithm is enhanced by using a logarithmic spiral strategy and a Gaussian distribution estimation strategy. The improved algorithm is then discretized and applied to solve the multi-UAV task allocation model. The simulation results show that the use of the real flight distance instead of the straight-line distance can plan a more reasonable task execution sequence and get a better combat profit under the consideration of the real terrain and various types of threats. The improved algorithm can solve the model stably and effectively, with better solution accuracy and faster convergence speed. © 2023 IEEE.","marine predator algorithm; path planning; task allocation; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Constrained optimization; Flight simulators; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Allocation methods; Allocation model; Allocation problems; Collaborative tasks; Combined optimization problem; Improved * algorithm; Marine predator algorithm; Task allocation; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Motion planning","Z.

First, compared with other Lyapunov vector fields, a settable parameter was added to the new RLVF, so as to balance the convergence speed and heading rate limitation in the tracking process and thus maximize the performance of UAVs. Then, theoretical analysis showed that with smaller parameter, the convergence speed was faster, but the heading angular rate was higher. Besides, the parameter selection method under the limitation of maximum heading angular rate was proposed to realize a faster convergence speed. Finally, in order to ensure that the UAVs can reach the target point from different initial positions at the same time, a cooperative speed controller based on τ coupling theory was designed. Without coping with the actual irregular flight paths, the proposed controller only needs to calculate the straight-line distance from the current point to the target point, avoiding the complicated path integration problem in existing 4D path planning methods, and the algorithm is simpler, which is more conducive to engineering implementation. Results of digital simulation and hardware-in-loop experiment showed that by the proposed method, UAVs could achieve simultaneous arrival and fast convergence to the standoff radius, indicating the effectiveness and superiority of the method as well as its engineering implementation value. © 2023 Harbin Institute of Technology.

Firstly, based on the cooperative interference of multiple UAVs, a model of common detection exposure area of networked radar is established.Then, according to the concept of safety zone in the jamming effectiveness evaluation criterion, a more objective and comprehensive jamming evaluation function model is established by combining the shortest distance between the manned aircraft and the exposed area boundary, the feasible area range for the manned aircraft to plan the safe track in the next step and the degree of suppression of the radar exposed area. Finally, based on the multi-pheromone ant colony algorithm, the adjustment and improvement are made to adjust the pheromone learning rate and path planning strategy more intelligently, improve the model optimization rate and optimization ability, and give the specific implementation logic. Through simulation, it is found that this method has more stable and fast convergence ability than traditional genetic algorithm, and has stronger global optimization ability than traditional ant colony algorithm.

To achieve the highest possible data rates, UAVs must be positioned optimally. For this cooperative communication to be most effective (maximizing data rates), the UAVs' positions and trajectories are critically important. Additionally, the limited onboard power supply, which depletes rapidly, becomes a decisive factor when burdened with transmission loads. In this research, UAV-assisted cooperative communication is explored, with a focus on moving UAVs rather than stationary ones. The objective is to maximize data rates through optimal trajectory planning, from the UAVs' initial positions to their final destinations, and through efficient utilization of onboard power resources. In this scenario, the UAVs harvest energy from the power received from the source and use it for further communication. A Mixed Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP) mathematical model is formulated to address these issues. Additionally, an efficient e-optimal algorithm is proposed, based on the mesh adaptive direct search method. This algorithm adaptively minimizes the search space of the problem using exploration and exploitation techniques to solve the non-convex MINLP model. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated through Monte Carlo simulation.  © 2023 IEEE.","cooperative communications; energy harvesting; Simulataneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT); Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Cooperative communication; Energy transfer; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Data-rate; Information and power transfers; Joint trajectories; Mixed integer; Nonlinear problems; Power profile; Simulataneous wireless information and power transfer; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle position; Energy harvesting","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835031890-6","","","English","Proc. - Int.

One of the primary challenges of UAV swarm technology is task allocation, which involves assigning tasks to individual drones within the swarm. Task allocation is a complex problem, and traditional algorithms may not be effective in large-scale and dynamic environments. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a task allocation model for UAV swarms aiming to optimize the task allocation process by considering the drones' capabilities and the requirements of the task while minimizing the overall energy consumption. Additionally, we discuss other challenges associated with UAV swarm technology, such as communication and routing protocols, swarm intelligence, collision avoidance, formation controls and task allocation algorithms. This research aims to identify key challenges and research gaps associated with the use of algorithms for UA V swarm task allocation and propose potential solutions and future research directions to overcome these challenges and enable the full potential of UAV swarm technology in various applications, such as precision agriculture.

How to dynamically determine a UAV swarm's cooperative path planning to best meet many users' spatio-temporally distributed demands is an important question but is unaddressed in the literature. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to design and analyze cooperative path planning algorithms of a large UAV swarm for optimally servicing many spatial locations, where ground users' demands are released dynamically in the long time horizon. Regarding a single UAV's path planning design, we manage to substantially simplify the traditional dynamic program and propose an optimal algorithm of low computation complexity, which is only polynomial with respect to both the numbers of spatial locations and user demands. After coordinating a large number K K of UAVs, this simplified dynamic optimization problem becomes intractable and we alternatively present a fast iterative cooperation algorithm with provable approximation ratio 1-(1-1K)K1-(1-1K)K in the worst case, which is proved to obviously outperform the traditional approach of partitioning UAVs to serve different location clusters separately. To relax UAVs' battery capacity limit for sustainable service provisioning, we further allow UAVs to travel to charging stations in the mean time and thus jointly design UAVs' path planning over users' locations and charging stations. Despite of the problem difficulty, for the optimal solution, we successfully transform the problem to an integer linear program by creating novel directed acyclic graph of the UAV-state transition diagram, and propose an iterative algorithm with constant approximation ratio. Finally, we validate the theoretical results by extensive simulations.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","approximation algorithms; battery charging stations; dynamic demands; optimal trajectory planning; UAV swarm cooperation","Antennas; Approximation algorithms; Charging (batteries); Cooperative communication; Directed graphs; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Iterative methods; Mathematical transformations; Motion planning; Secondary batteries; Trajectories; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aerial vehicle; Battery charging station; Charging station; Dynamic demand; Heuristics algorithm; Optimal trajectory planning; Optimisations; Swarm cooperation; Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm cooperation; Vehicle's dynamics; Wireless communications; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","X.

Earlier work has shown that a group of UAVs can successfully circumscribe a plume of hazardous contaminants in the air and map the boundary of such a spill. In this paper, we show that this idea can be extended to plumes which contain elements heavier than air and, as such, fall to the ground such that they approximately form a spherical dome. Mapping such a boundary is challenging because UAVs need to follow the plume as close to the ground as possible without crashing.

To overcome the limitation of limited onboard energy and long search time for path planning by a single UAV, a multi-UAV path planning scheme is designed specifically for radar-threat environments. This scheme ensures that UAVs, while satisfying certain energy constraints, establish a Multi-UAV Multi-node Path Cost (MMPC) model. Each UAV needs to access different nodes with varying data volumes to upload while avoiding radar threats as much as possible. The objective is to find the optimal flight path for each UAV for minimizing the total path costs. Based on the basic Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) framework, this approach incorporates virtual nodes, modifies node selection strategies, adjusts path visibility factors and introduces the 2-opt method for node swapping. These enhancements improve the search efficiency to a certain extent, enhance the path diversity within the population and prevent the premature convergence to the local optima. Simulation results demonstrate the improved ACO's good convergence and the minimized path cost, thus validating its effectiveness. © 2023 IEEE.","Ant Colony Optimization; energy consumption constraint; path cost; path planning; UAV","Antennas; Energy utilization; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Collaborative execution; Data collection; Energy consumption constraints; Extended networks; Interference networks; Path cost; Radar threat; Reduced energy consumption; Vehicle path planning; Ant colony optimization","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835031657-5","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In this paper, we fully consider the distribution of rescue areas, the type of tasks and the characteristics of UAVs, and design the TaskPOI-based multi-UAVs collaborative trajectory planning algorithm (TMCTP) based on regional tasks, aiming to improve the completed efficiency of rescue tasks and the utilization rate of energy consumption in the UAV backbone network. Firstly, we filter the population-intensive points of interest (PiPOI) region based on the location heat map of population density distribution and use the K-means clustering algorithm to generate task points of interest (TaskPOI) and use the neural collaborative filtering algorithm to determine the task priority and different priorities correspond to different task types. Then, we design a single UAV flight model and a multi-UAVs cooperative flight model. At the same time, considering the flight energy consumption, communication energy consumption and data acquisition energy consumption of UAV, the energy consumption equilibrium distribution model is designed to ensure that multi-UAVs have low energy consumption and balance the residual energy distribution while completing various levels of tasks. Finally, based on UAV flight model, energy consumption equilibrium distribution model, and combined with task priority of TaskPOI, TMCTP algorithm for the trajectory planning of the UAV group is designed by using multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. The experimental results show that in the TMCTP algorithm, the success rate of the UAV arriving at the goal and the completed rate of the action are converged to 1, the times of collisions is converged to 0, and the average reward, the loss of algorithm are all converged to a good degree, and the PiPOI coverage rate in the area exceeds 60%. In terms of energy consumption, the difference between the energy consumption of each UAV is small, and compared with the average residual energy using GP3, the difference is not large, indicating that the algorithm can improve the PiPOI coverage of the entire rescue area without generating a large energy consumption. In this way, the UAV group after arriving at the goal will provide communication services for the rescue area and improve the connectivity and life cycle of the 6G air network. © 2017 IEEE.","6G; balanced distribution of energy consumption; multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-UAVs cooperation; trajectory planning algorithm","4G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Collaborative filtering; Cooperative communication; Data acquisition; Energy utilization; Gaussian distribution; Heuristic methods; Internet of things; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Multi agent systems; Population statistics; Reinforcement learning; Software agents; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; 6g; 6g mobile communication; Balanced distribution of energy consumption; Collaboration; Distribution of energy consumption; Energy-consumption; Heuristics algorithm; Mobile communications; Multi UAV; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-UAV cooperation; Task analysis; Trajectory Planning; Trajectory planning algorithm; Heuristic algorithms","G.

With the WLS, a weighted mean point of the top solutions is developed to evolve the population. Additionally, several simple local search mechanisms are introduced to prevent the algorithm from premature convergence. Moreover, the WLS possesses fewer constant coefficients to reduce the parameter sensitivity. The performance of the WLS is evaluated with the CEC 2017 test suite with 10D, 30D, 50D and 100D problems, the CEC 2008 test suite with 100D, 500D and 1000D problems, large-scale benchmarks with 100D, 500D and 1000D (or beyond) problems and constrained engineering design problems. The statistical results of the experiments indicate that the WLS exhibits an outstanding ability among the state-of-the art algorithms in different competitions, which verifies the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithm in solving complex problems, as well as its robustness in large-scale evaluation. Moreover, the WLS is employed to address the cooperative path planning problem of an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) swarm with 100 members. Through problem model construction, the path planning issue is transformed into a constrained optimization problem and solved by the WLS. The experimental results show that the proposed WLS is able to solve the path planning problem in real time within the constraints and significantly outperforms the other competitors, demonstrating the accuracy and time savings of the algorithm in solving real-world optimization problems. © 2022","CEC 2008; CEC 2017; Large-scale optimization; Metaheuristic algorithm; Numerical optimization; Path planning; UAV; Weighted-leader search","Benchmarking; Constrained optimization; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aircraft vehicles; CEC 2008; CEC 2017; Large-scale optimization; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Numerical optimizations; Simple++; Unmanned aircraft vehicle; Unmanned aircrafts; Weighted-leader search; Motion planning","X.

In this context, the UAV trajectory planning and caching strategies assume paramount importance to ensure low-latency service delivery. Due to the limited caching and computing resources at a single UAV, it alone cannot provide effective services for a large number of GUs. In this paper, we design a novel cooperative framework for low-latency service provisioning by coordinating multiple UAVs's trajectories and service caching strategies. We formulate a latency minimization problem to jointly optimize both service caching and trajectory planning of multiple UAVs. However, due to the high dimension and coupling of multiple UAVs' movement and service caching, the optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, which is typically an NP-hard problem, and we propose an effective algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient to solve the high dimensional, non-convex, and continuous long-term optimization problem. Numerous experiments confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly better performance in reducing the total system delay than other baseline algorithms. © 2023 IEEE.","deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG); Multi-access edge computing (MEC); service caching; trajectory control; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Computational complexity; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Deep deterministic policy gradient; Deterministics; Edge computing; Multi-access edge computing; Multiaccess; Policy gradient; Service caching; Trajectory control; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Edge computing","X.

Even parallel deployment of heterogeneous autonomous assets as swarms or cooperating teams is no longer science fiction, but a realistic operational scenario. Their effectiveness can be significantly increased by optimization of number, capabilities and application strategy of assigned assets, particularly in time-critical tasks (e.g. the search for missing persons, disaster relief and modern warfare operations). Especially, the movements of the vehicles must be carefully managed. However, the use of small UxVs is often accompanied by limitations like short mission time and limited sensor coverage, which in turn can be compensated by the intelligent assignment of vehicles with increased autonomy in cooperating groups. An important basis for efficient and effective autonomous reconnaissance, especially in swarming or teaming scenarios, is movement optimization considering the capabilities of the heterogeneous vehicles equipped with different sensor systems operating in a combined mission. For this purpose, algorithms have been developed at Fraunhofer IOSB that enable appropriate planning and dynamic processing in very different situations for heterogeneous groups of cooperating vehicles.

Simulation validation suggests that the fusion algorithm proves to be more capable of maintaining UAVs in stable formation and detecting the target, compared with the model predictive control algorithm alone, in the process of tracking the moving target in a complex 3D environment. © 2023 by the authors.","formation tracking control; intelligent computing; model predictive control; standoff algorithm; UAV trajectory planning","Aircraft detection; Digital elevation model; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Formation tracking; Formation tracking control; Fusion algorithms; Model-predictive control; Moving targets; Multi UAV; Standoff algorithm; Tracking controls; Trajectory Planning; UAV trajectory planning; Predictive control systems","B.

However, the existing trajectory planning algorithms do not consider the division method and operating rules of the ultra-low-altitude airspace. They are not suitable for the collaborative trajectory planning of multiple UAVs in the urban ultra-low-altitude air transportation scenario, which may restrict the development of the ultra-low-altitude air transportation industry. This paper explores a multi-UAV collaborative trajectory planning method for urban ultra-low-altitude air transportation scenario based on the airspace flight altitude layer architecture. Specifically, the paper decomposes the original problem into two coupled sub-problems: UAV flight altitude layer task assignment and multi-UAV single-altitude coordinated trajectory planning. It uses the task assignment solution based on mapping knowledge domains and the swarm-based improved artificial potential field method to solve these two sub-problems respectively. Simulation results show that the method can not only avoid the inherent defects of traditional methods in solving the cooperative trajectory planning sub-problem but also reduce the average number of iterations by 62.09% compared with the traditional method. At the same time, the simulation results also show that the proposed method solves the original problem fast and robustly, which can provide a feasible trajectory for multi-UAVs in urban ultra-low-altitude air transportation scenario. © 2023 Acta Simulata Systematica Sinica.

The algorithm proposed in this paper uses a hierarchical framework that is divided into a 4D cooperative planning layer and a local threat avoidance planning layer. In the cooperative planning layer, the proposed algorithm, named dynamic priority rapidly exploring random trees (DPRRT*), would be used for the 4D cooperative path planning of all UAVs involved in a given task. We first designed a heuristic prioritization strategy in the DPRRT* algorithm to rank all UAVs to improve the efficiency of cooperative planning. Then, the improved RRT* algorithm with the 4D coordination cost function was used to plan the 4D coordination path for each UAV. Whenever the environment changes dynamically (i.e., sudden static or moving threats), the proposed heuristic artificial potential field algorithm (HAPF) in the local threat avoidance planning layer is used to plan the local collision avoidance path. After completing local obstacle avoidance planning, the DPRRT* of the 4D cooperative planning layer is again called upon for path replanning to finally realize 4D cooperative path planning for all UAVs. The simulation and comparison experiments prove the feasibility, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed algorithm. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial potential field (APF); four-dimensional (4D) dynamic cooperative path planning; multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs); rapidly exploring random trees (RRT*)","Aircraft accidents; Decision trees; Dynamic programming; Heuristic algorithms; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Artificial potential field; Artificial potential fields; Cooperative path planning; Dimensional dynamics; Dynamic priority; Four-dimensional  dynamic cooperative path planning; Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle; Rapidly exploring random tree; Rapidly-exploring random trees; Cost functions","X.

Firstly, multiple constraints are constituted based on the blind zone of Dopplcr velocity, radar detection angle and range boundary, and so on. Then, an objective function is established for the purpose of steady tracking of maneuvering targets. The mathematical model of the cooperative path planning problem is established by the objective function and constraints. Finally, the mathematical model is quickly solved by the proposed adaptive primal-dual iterative (APDI) algorithm to obtain flight paths of UAVs in real time. Comparative simulation results show that the proposed method can realize fast cooperative path planning for a continuous and steady tracking of maneuvering targets. The APDI is a low complexity algorithm and has a higher solving speed with a 10% improvement in comparison with Gauss pseudospectral method and model predictive control method. Moreover, the UAV path solved by the proposed method is smooth, which can reduce the fuel consumption of UAV in flight, allowing for longer detection in the air. © 2023 Xi'an Jiaotong University.

The growing complexity of UAV applications such as disaster management, plant protection, and environment monitoring, has resulted in escalating and stringent requirements for UAV networks that a single UAV cannot fulfill. To address this, multi-UAV wireless networks (MUWNs) have emerged, offering enhanced resource-carrying capacity and enabling collaborative mission completion by multiple UAVs. However, the effective operation of MUWNs necessitates a higher level of autonomy and intelligence, particularly in decision-making and multi-objective optimization under diverse environmental conditions. Reinforcement Learning (RL), an intelligent and goal-oriented decision-making approach, has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the intricate tasks associated with MUWNs. As one may notice, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in RL-based MUWNs. Thus, this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive review of RL-based approaches in the context of autonomous MUWNs. We present an informative overview of RL and demonstrate its application within the framework of MUWNs. Specifically, we summarize various applications of RL in MUWNs, including data access, sensing and collection, resource allocation for wireless connectivity, UAV-assisted mobile edge computing, localization, trajectory planning, and network security. Furthermore, we identify and discuss several open challenges based on the insights gained from our review.  © ; 2023 IEEE.","multi-UAV wireless network; reinforcement learning; UAV-assisted communication network; UAV-assisted mobile computing; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Mobile computing; Mobile edge computing; Multiobjective optimization; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wireless networks; Aerial vehicle; Communications networks; Heuristics algorithm; Mobile-computing; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle wireless network; Optimisations; Reinforcement learnings; Resource management; Tutorial; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted communication network; Unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted mobile computing; Heuristic algorithms","Z.

To efficiently capture high-quality images of power equipment, we propose a method for automatically generating joint inspection points for multiple intelligent equipment. It introduces a shooting potential model and a spatial relationship model to assess the suitability of shooting power equipment at different spatial points using various intelligent equipment. A point selection method is designed based on shooting quality constraints and spatial constraints to optimize inspection efficiency. The focus is on generating non-redundant and complete inspection points that are suitable for multiple intelligent equipment to perform with. Additionally, we study cooperative path planning of the heterogeneous robot systems to reduce the time required for the inspection task. An improved Ant-Lion Optimization Algorithm is proposed to decouple the routes of mobile robots and UAVs and plan their routes simultaneously. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a virtual substation experimental platform, revealing improvements in shooting quality, inspection efficiency, and reduced inspection time. © 2023 IEEE.","inspection points; intelligent equipment; path planning; shooting quality; the improved Ant-Lion Optimization Algorithm","Antennas; Efficiency; Electric substations; Intelligent robots; Motion planning; Optimization; Robot programming; Aerial vehicle; Automatic Generation; Generation method; Inspection efficiency; Inspection point; Intelligent equipment; Optimization algorithms; Power equipment; Shooting quality; The improved ant-lion optimization algorithm; Inspection","","Li G.; Li Z.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835034009-9","","","English","Proc. - Power Syst.

Therefore, the multi-constraint mixed integer programming models of track planning and cooperative delivery path planning were constructed respectively, and A∗ algorithm and adaptive large-scale domain search algorithm were used to solve the track planning and path planning models respectively. Firstly, the simulation environment of UAV flight track planning is constructed by using digital elevation data, and the multi-objective flight track planning function is solved by A∗ algorithm to get the results. Then, the output results of UAV three-dimensional flight track planning, such as distance and energy consumption, were input into the integrated collaborative delivery mode as parameters to provide decision support for the solution process and obtain better solutions. The simulation results show that in the collaborative delivery mode, the navigation distance data obtained by using the three-dimensional flight track planning of UAV is closer to the actual application scene than the traditional Euclidean distance, which increases the practical application value of this mode.

In complex environments, the status of task points is constantly changing. A single UAV or UGV cannot flexibly adjust its monitoring strategy to prevent intruder and cannot quickly and efficiently deal with abnormal situations at task points. The cooperation of multiple UAV sand UGVs have higher efficiency and can maintain the monitoring targets in a timely manner. This paper establishes a cooperative path planning model for multiple UAVs and UGVs to address these issues. The persistent monitoring tasks are formulated by minimizing the maximum risk coefficient of monitoring assignments, and a rolling optimization path planning model is established.

The perception of a USV is usually interfered by the swing of the hull and the ambient weather, making it challenging to plan optimal USV trajectories. In this paper, a cooperative trajectory planning algorithm for a coupled USV-UAV system is proposed to ensure that a USV can execute a safe and smooth path as it autonomously advances through multi-obstacle maps. Specifically, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays the role of a flight sensor, providing real-time global map and obstacle information with a lightweight semantic segmentation network and 3D projection transformation. An initial obstacle avoidance trajectory is generated by a graph-based search method. Concerning the unique under-actuated kinematic characteristics of the USV, a numerical optimization method based on hull dynamic constraints is introduced to make the trajectory easier to be tracked for motion control. Finally, a motion control method based on NMPC with the lowest energy consumption constraint during execution is proposed. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the whole system, and the generated trajectory is locally optimal for USV with considerable tracking accuracy. © 2023 by the authors.","hull dynamics; numerical optimization; trajectory generation; under-actuated constraint; USV-UAV cooperation","Antennas; Graphic methods; Motion control; Motion planning; Optimization; Semantics; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned surface vehicles; Aerial vehicle; Complex dynamics; Dynamic constraints; Hull dynamic; Numerical optimizations; Trajectory generation; Trajectory planning algorithm; Under-actuated constraint; Underactuated; Unmanned surface vehicle-unmanned aerial vehicle cooperation; Numerical methods","Z.

In large-scale monitoring scenarios, deploying a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers improved spatial coverage and robustness against individual failures. However, a key challenge is cooperative path planning for the UAVs to efficiently achieve a joint mission goal. We propose a novel multi-agent informative path planning approach based on deep reinforcement learning for adaptive terrain monitoring scenarios using UAV teams. We introduce new network feature representations to effectively learn path planning in a 3D workspace. By leveraging a counterfactual baseline, our approach explicitly addresses credit assignment to learn cooperative behaviour. Our experimental evaluation shows improved planning performance, i.e. maps regions of interest more quickly, with respect to non-counterfactual variants. Results on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art non-learning-based methods, while being transferable to varying team sizes and communication constraints. © 2023 IEEE.","","Antennas; Behavioral research; Deep learning; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Adaptive path planning; Aerial vehicle; Counterfactuals; Data collection; Large-scale monitoring; Learn+; Performance; Reinforcement learnings; Remote sensing applications; Spatial robustness; Motion planning","J.

UAVs play an important role in the emergency communication system. Due to the limited airborne energy of a UAV, it is a critical technical issue to effectively design flight routes to complete rescue missions. We fully consider the distribution of the rescue area, the type of mission, and the flight characteristics of the UAV. Firstly, according to the distribution of the crowd, the PSO algorithm is used to cluster the target-POI of the task area, and the neural collaborative filtering algorithm is used to prioritize the target-POI. Then we also design a Trans-UTPA algorithm. Based on MAPPO 's policy network and value function, we introduce transformer model to make Trans-UTPA's policy learning have no action space limitation and can be multi-task parallel, which improves the efficiency and generalization of sample processing. In a three-dimensional space, the UAV selects the emergency task to be performed (data acquisition and networking communication) based on strategic learning of state information (location information, energy consumption information, etc.) and action information (horizontal flight, ascent, and descent), and then designs the UAV flight path based on the maximization of the global value function. The experimental results show that the performance of the Trans-UTPA algorithm is further improved compared with the USCTP algorithm in terms of the success rate of each UAV reaching the target position, the number of collisions, and the average reward of the algorithm. Among them, the average reward of the algorithm exceeds the USCTP algorithm by 13%, and the number of collisions is reduced by 60%. Compared with the heuristic algorithm, it can cover more target-POIs, and has less energy consumption than the heuristic algorithm.

This system has to be energy efficient for its nature and functionalities. Optimized trajectory planning is a significant area of research for any automatic movable device. In this article, we propose a technique, called EETO-GA for energy-efficient trajectory optimization of UAV–IoT using a genetic algorithm (GA). This technique prescribes each device of: (i) the next timestamp of arrival on the present cluster of IoT devices, at which the task queue of its header contains the highest possible number of tasks, and (ii) the minimum amount of energy that requires to complete all the tasks present in task queue of the IoT device. This technique uses a GA for optimization where the fitness function is designed by optimizing objectives: (i) the total number of tasks that can be completed, (ii) minimization of consumed energy, and (iii) the number of devices that could be served. A GA is applied here to accommodate a large number of IoT devices. A binary method of encoding is applied and methods like cross-over and mutation are used to arrive at the optimal solution. Through a simulation study, the proposed technique shows significant improvement in terms of UAV energy saved (UAVE), energy saving in IoT devices (IoTDEC), the average delay in execution of the task (ADET), and the percentage of tasks that could be completed (PTSK). Proposed EETO-GA improved average UAVE: 43%, IoTDEC: 56%, PTSK: 7.5%, and ADET: 38% over the state of the art. © 2023 by the authors.","ARMA model; clustered model; delay aware; energy efficient; internet of thing; path planning; trajectory optimization; unmanned aerial vehicles","","M.M.H.

Especially in the scenarios involving multiple UAVs, this problem is highly challenging due to the constraints of complex environments, various tasks and inherent UAV maneuverability. In this paper, a cooperative path planning model for multiple UAVs is presented. In addition to common limitations such as the path length minimization, UAV maneuverability limitation and collision avoidance, the communication requirements between UAVs and the impact of obstacles in the flight environment on the quality of communication are also taken into account in the presented path planning model. On this basis, the corresponding objective function is designed. Then, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the above path planning problem. Utilizing the ideas of the dynamic multi-swarm PSO (DMSPSO) algorithm and the comprehensive learning PSO (CLPSO) algorithm, the proposed algorithm, denoted as CL-DMSPSO, further improves the performance of both algorithms. The effectiveness and superiority of the novel CL-DMSPSO algorithm is verified on benchmark functions, especially for complex multimodal functions. Finally, we present an effective path planning method using CL-DMSPSO to generate optimized flyable paths for multiple UAVs.

However, this approach is not always practical in real-time applications due to the connection instability, limited bandwidth, and end-to-end latency. One promising solution is to divide the inference requests into multiple parts (layers or segments), with each part being executed in a different UAV based on the available resources. Furthermore, some applications require the UAVs to traverse certain areas and capture incidents; thus, planning their paths becomes critical particularly, to reduce the latency of making the collaborative inference process. Specifically, planning the UAVs trajectory can reduce the data transmission latency by communicating with devices in the same proximity while mitigating the transmission interference. This work aims to design a model for distributed collaborative inference requests and path planning in a UAV swarm while respecting the resource constraints due to the computational load and memory usage of the inference requests. The model is formulated as an optimization problem and aims to minimize latency. The formulated problem is NP-hard so finding the optimal solution is quite complex; thus, this article introduces a real-time and dynamic solution for online applications using deep reinforcement learning. We conduct extensive simulations and compare our results to the state-of-the-art studies demonstrating that our model outperforms the competing models.  © 2023 IEEE.","Classification decision; convolutional neural networks (CNNs); distributed inference; latency; optimization; path planning; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Data handling; Deep learning; Maneuverability; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Border monitoring; Classification decision; CNN network; Distributed inference; Latency; Manoeuvrability; Optimisations; Reinforcement learnings; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Motion planning","A.

In air-ground vehicle formations, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are equipped with low-precision inertial navigation measurement units and wireless range sensors, which interact with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-precision navigation equipment for cooperative measurement information and use the UAVs as aerial benchmarks for cooperative navigation. Firstly, the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm is used to predict the next moment’s motion position of the UGVs. Then regional real-time path optimization algorithms are introduced to design the motion position of the high-precision UAVs so as to improve the formation’s configuration and reduce the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) of the configuration. Simulation results show that the Dynamic Optimal Configuration Cooperative Navigation (DOC-CN) algorithm can reduce the GDOP of heterogeneous air-ground vehicle formations and effectively improve the overall navigation accuracy of the whole formation.

However, the short battery life and moderate computational capability hinder UAVs to process computation-intensive tasks. The emerging edge computing technologies can alleviate this problem by offloading tasks to the ground edge servers. How to evaluate the search process so as to make optimal offloading decisions and make optimal flying trajectories represent fundamental research challenges. In this paper, we propose to utilize the concept of uncertainty to evaluate the search process, which reflects the reliability of the target search results. Thereafter, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to jointly make optimal computation offloading decisions and flying orientation choices for multi-UAV cooperative target search. Specifically, we first formulate an uncertainty minimization problem based on the established system model. By introducing a reward function, we prove that the uncertainty minimization problem is equivalent to a reward maximization problem, which is further analyzed by a Markov decision process (MDP). To obtain the optimal task offloading decisions and flying orientation choices, a deep Q-network (DQN) based DRL architecture with a separated Q-network is then proposed. Finally, extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and comprehensive discussions on how different parameters affect the search performance are given.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","computation offloading; cooperative target search; deep reinforcement learning (DRL); edge computing; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; computation offloading; Deep learning; Job analysis; Markov processes; Trajectories; Uncertainty analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Computation offloading; Cooperative target search; Cooperative targets; Deep reinforcement learning; Edge computing; Reinforcement learnings; Search problem; Target search; Task analysis; Uncertainty; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Reinforcement learning","Q.

HDP-TSRRT* is a hierarchical decoupling algorithm. First, all UAV pre-paths are planned simultaneously at the synchronous decentralized planning level. Second, at the coordination path level, the heuristic decentralized prioritized planning algorithm (HDP) is proposed to quickly complete the coordination process of the path planning sequence. This strategy assigns reasonable and robust priority to all UAVs based on the performance evaluation function composed of the number of potential collisions and the violation of collaboration time of the pre-planned path. Third, the time–space cooperative constraints-based RRT* algorithm (TSRRT*) is proposed at the single-machine cooperative path planning level. Based on this, the algorithm uses multiple sampling and cost evaluation strategies to guide the expansion of new nodes, and then optimizes neighborhood nodes based on the time coordination cost function so as to improve the efficiency of coordination path planning. Simulation and comparison show that HDP-TSRRT* has certain advantages in algorithm performance. © 2023 by the authors.","decentralized prioritized planning; heuristic prioritization; multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs); rapidly exploring random trees (RRT*); time–space cooperative path planning","Aircraft accidents; Decision trees; Heuristic algorithms; Motion planning; Random forests; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Cooperative path planning; Decentralised; Decentralized prioritized planning; Heuristic prioritization; Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle; Prioritization; Rapidly exploring random tree; Rapidly-exploring random trees; Time-space; Time–space cooperative path planning; Cost functions","X.

Especially in time-critical tasks (e.g. the search for missing persons, disaster relief and modern warfare operations) mass deployment of unmanned vehicles can be useful for obvious reasons. An important basis for efficient and effective autonomous reconnaissance or surveillance with an increasing task complexity or number of mobile vehicles is movement optimization considering the boundary conditions like vehicles or sensor capabilities. Special algorithms for such complex reconnaissance missions have been developed at Fraunhofer IOSB that enable fast appropriate planning and dynamic processing in very different situations with minimal effort of the operator.

For a certain search area, UAVs may need to search it repeatedly to obtain a high-confidence result about the target distribution in the search area. However, the short battery life and moderate computational capability restrict UAVs to repeatedly execute the computation-intensive and energy-consuming search tasks. To address the issue, in this paper, we utilize edge computing to develop a continual and cooperative UAV search mechanism. Specifically, we first establish an edge computing enabled multi-UAV cooperative search framework, in which the mobility model of UAV, search task computing and offloading models are presented. An uncertainty minimization problem is then formulated, aiming to obtain a high-efficiency and high-confidence search result at the unpredictable uncertainty in search area. Considering that round-trip energy consumption, offloading decision-making, and trajectory planning may contribute to the reduction in uncertainty, we propose an uncertainty minimization-based cooperative target search (UMCTS) strategy. Finally, extensive simulation results validate that UMCTS can outperform the existing strategies and achieve at least 89% performance gain on average uncertainty. Based on the results, we also present a comprehensive analysis and discussion on how different parameters affect the search performance. © 2023 IEEE.","cooperative target search; edgecomputing; energy-efficient offloading; uncertaintyminimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Computation offloading; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Job analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Computational modelling; Cooperative target search; Cooperative targets; Edge computing; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient offloading; Heuristics algorithm; Minimisation; Search problem; Target search; Task analysis; Uncertainty; Uncertainty minimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Heuristic algorithms","Q.

According to the complexity of the mission, some configurations are required both in terms of hardware and software. This task becomes even more complex when the system is composed of autonomous UAVs that collaborate with each other without the assistance of an operator. Several factors must be considered, such as the complexity of the mission, the types of UAVs, the communication architecture, the routing protocol, the coordination of tasks, and many other factors related to the environment. Unfortunately, although there are many research works that address the use cases of multi-UAV systems, there is a gap in the literature regarding the difficulties involved with the implementation of these systems from scratch. This review article seeks to examine and understand the communication issues related to the implementation from scratch of autonomous multi-UAV systems for collaborative decisions. The manuscript will also provide a formal definition of the ecosystem of a multi-UAV system, as well as a comparative study of UAV types and related works that highlight the use cases of multi-UAV systems. In addition to the mathematical modeling of the collaborative target detection problem in distributed environments, this article establishes a comparative study of communication architectures and routing protocols in a UAV network. After reading this review paper, readers will benefit from the multicriteria decision-making roadmaps to choose the right architectures and routing protocols adapted for specific missions. The open challenges and future directions described in this manuscript can be used to understand the current limitations and how to overcome them to effectively exploit autonomous swarms in future trends. © 2023 by the authors.","autonomous aerial vehicles; autonomous swarm; collaborative missions; communication architectures; distributed environment; distributed path planning; drones; FANET; multi-UAV systems; routing protocols; RPAS; UAS; UAV; uncrewed aerial vehicles","Aircraft communication; Aircraft detection; Autonomous vehicles; Reviews; Swarm intelligence; Vehicle routing; Aerial vehicle; Autonomous swarms; Collaborative mission; Communication architectures; Distributed environments; Distributed path planning; FANET; Multi-uncrewed aerial vehicle system; Routing-protocol; RPAS; UAS; Uncrewed aerial vehicles; Vehicle system; Drones","W.Y.H.

The emphasis of this paper lies in addressing the logistics distribution challenges associated with individual vehicles and drones. This paper established a two-level path planning model for truck and drone collaborative logistics distribution. Based on the characteristics of truck-and-drone collaborative logistics distribution problems, various specific neighborhood structures and an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism have been meticulously designed, after that, an adaptive simulated annealing algorithm (ASA) was proposed. The results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently searches for satisfactory solutions for the collaborative delivery path between trucks and drones across various delivery ranges and quantities of packages in a relatively short timeframe. The cost of truck-and-drone collaborative delivery is reduced by approximately 50.25%, 14.13%, and 7% compared to the initial solution of truck separate delivery, vehicle machine collaborative delivery, and the optimal solution of the traditional simulated annealing algorithm, respectively. This method effectively reduces logistics delivery costs. © 2023 IEEE.","adaptive mechanism; logistics distribution; neighborhood structure; simulated annealing algorithm; truck and drone collaboration; two-layer path planning","Automobiles; Cost reduction; Drones; Intelligent systems; Simulated annealing; Trucks; Adaptive mechanism; Adaptive simulated annealing algorithm; Annealing algorithm; Collaborative logistics; Logistic distributions; Neighborhood structure; Simulated annealing algorithm; Truck and drone collaboration; Two-layer; Two-layer path planning; Motion planning","Z.

However, when the multiple UAVs collect data onto the same area, there is a problem of overlapping coverage areas, which will result in low energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper studies the energy-efficient collaborative path planning problem to maximize data collection of UAVs from distributed sensors. Based on built multi-UAVs assisted system for collecting sensors data, we formulate the optimization objective to maximize the data collected by the UAV group within the limits of energy and the total covered area. To solve the problem of UAVs' collaborative path planning, we propose a Hexagonal Area Search (HAS) algorithm, which is combined with multi-agents Deep Q-Network(DQN), called HAS-DQN. By limiting the total coverage of UAVs, HAS-DQN can effectively avoid collision problems with UAVs. Experiments show that HAS-DQN can effectively solve the path overlap problem of multiple UAVs moving at the same cost in an unknown environment. © 2022","Energy-efficient; HAS-DQN; Limited total area; Multi-UAVs path planning; UAV group","","F.

It is meaningful to plan its coverage path combined with the sensor model. Previous works mainly used decentralized coverage to realize UAV formation cooperative operation, but for the aerial photography scene of a single task, the decentralized coverage algorithm is not effective. In this paper, a centralized coverage algorithm of UAV formation for aerial photography is proposed, which is divided into two sub-problems: coverage path planning and formation control. In the coverage path planning, due to high repetition rate and excessive number of turns of the traditional PRM algorithm, the constraint of the number of turns is introduced, and the back-and-forth mode is used to improve it. In formation control, in order to more accurately evaluate the performance of the coverage path, it refers to the consensus theory and combines the artificial potential field method to guide the reverse-V UAV formation to follow the coverage path. Multi-group simulations show that the proposed algorithm is feasible to implement the concentrated coverage for aerial photography under the comprehensive consideration of path length, number of turns, calculation time, coverage rate and repeating rate.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","aerial photography; concentrated coverage; improved PRM; Path planning; UAV formation","Aerial photography; Antennas; Image enhancement; Image sensors; Motion planning; Probabilistic logics; Sensor networks; Aerial photography; Concentrated coverage; Coverage algorithms; Coverage path planning; Decentralised; Formation control; Improved PRM; Path-planning algorithm; Task analysis; UAV formation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","X.

The three degrees of freedom model of the unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) will be established first. Then, the development of current tau theory is introduced and an improved tau-j guidance strategy is proposed. The improved tau-j guidance strategy addresses the discontinuity of velocity and acceleration at the navigation point in the original tau-j theory. The speed and acceleration of the generated four-dimensional trajectory are controlled to meet the flight requirements of the UCAV. Finally, a cost function considering the length of the flight path, flight time, collision avoidance, maximum acceleration, minimum and maximum speed of UCAV is proposed. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the four-dimensional trajectory of the UCAV.

Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) could provide safe and vital life-saving reinforcement when evacuating populations from a large-scale disaster site. However, navigation in disaster-affected environments is vulnerable to the presence of unpredictable moving obstacles. Existing solutions perform optimal route determination while considering the presence of a single rescue vehicle. To optimize path planning and enhance energy efficiency in the presence of a fleet of rescue vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), multiple sources and target destinations, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Dijkstra (MADRD) algorithm in a sixth generation (6G) assisted environment to achieve cooperative navigation in the Route Planning Framework. The MADRD algorithm allows vehicles to learn from the experiences and behavior of other CAVs to obtain an optimal path from the source to the affected target site. Route selection and throttle parameters are optimized to achieve efficient fuel consumption, reduced travel time and lower traffic congestion. We simulate the Route Planning Framework on a large-scale real-world road network. The experimental results indicate that MADRD achieves 40% less fuel consumption, 45% higher road throughput and 34% less evacuation time than its state-of-the-art counterparts.  © 2022 IEEE.","6G; Connected autonomous vehicles; deep reinforcement learning; emergency evacuation; multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient; route planning; UAV","Antennas; Energy efficiency; Fleet operations; Fuels; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Motion planning; Multi agent systems; Navigation; Reinforcement learning; Roads and streets; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 6g; Adaptation models; Autonomous Vehicles; Connected autonomous vehicle; Deterministics; Emergency evacuation; Multi agent; Multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient; Policy gradient; Route planning; Route planning.; Deep learning","G.

In recent years, UAVs have been widely used in a variety of scenarios due to their many advantages, including aiding path planning for UGVs on the ground. Most path planning assumes a digital map. However, in situations where a map is not available, especially in search and rescue operations where the operating environment is often a disaster or post-disaster area, it is very difficult for ground-based UGVs to explore the unknown environment. The use of UAVs flying in the airspace above the UGV enables a rapid search of the surrounding environment and guides the rescue operations of the UGV. Ground-based UGVs carrying rescue facilities can enable rescue operations that cannot be completed by UAVs. Therefore, we propose a collaborative air-ground cross-domain unmanned system path planning framework, with the generation of global paths based on the improved A* algorithm. Based on this, path management is used to update the waypoints. The path tracking algorithm PID and collision avoidance method VFH are used to optimise the local paths. A visual guidance method is introduced to ensure that the UAS is as close to the target as possible to complete the mission. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of the approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Air-ground cooperation; Path planning; Search and rescue; UAVs; UGVs","Aircraft accidents; Disasters; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Motion planning; Air grounds; Air-ground cooperation; Design and implementations; Digital map; Ground based; Planning framework; Rescue operations; Search and rescue; UGV; Unmanned system; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","C.

A bi-layer collaborative solution framework is also proposed. The outer layer optimizes the allocation scheme between the UAVs and targets, whereas the inner layer generates the UAV path and evaluates the outer scheme. In the outer layer, a unified encoding based on the grouping and pairing relationship between UAVs and targets is proposed. The corresponding combinatorial mutation operators are then designed for the representative NSGA-II, MOEA/D-AWA, and DMOEA-εC algorithms. In the inner layer, an efficient heuristic algorithm is used to solve the path planning of each UAV group. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the cooperative bi-layer solution scheme and the combined mutation operators. At the same time, compared with the NSGA-II and MOEA/D-AWA, DMOEA-εC can obtain a significantly better Pareto front and can weigh the assigned number of UAVs and the total task completion time to generate more diversified reconnaissance confirmation execution schemes. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.","heterogeneous UAVs; multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; path planning; task allocation; task planning","Antennas; Computational complexity; Evolutionary algorithms; Fixed wings; Heuristic algorithms; Motion planning; Aerial vehicle; Bi-layer; Heterogeneous UAV; Inner layer; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Mutation operators; NSGA-II; Outer layer; Task allocation; Task planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","B.

First, the environment is displayed in the form of a grid. Then, the enhanced algorithm divides the task area for UAVs. Finally, each UAV performs SAR path planning in the mission area. The tasks of mapping the environment and searching for target points by UAV swarms are discussed in this study.

These optimization problems are interacted. To achieve the global optimal solution of the UAVs mission planning, these three optimization problems should be fully considered and organized. In this paper, considering the requirements and interactions among the three optimization problems, a double-level planning framework is firstly introduced, and then the whole mission planning problem is decomposed into two parts: the high level task allocation and the low level sequence optimization. The optimization models and methods for each level are subsequently developed and detailed. In the process of task allocation, a simulated-annealing-shooting (SAS) is proposed for overcoming the local-optimal-trap, and the configuration principle of the algorithm parameters are discussed. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planning framework and the SAS algorithm. © 2022 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

Since the traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms tend to fall into local optimum solutions when dealing with optimization problems in three dimensions, we suggest an advanced estimation of distribution algorithm. The main idea of this algorithm is to integrate the adaptive deflation of the selection rate, adaptive evolution of the covariance matrix, comprehensive evaluation of individual convergence and diversity, and reference point-based non-dominated ranking. A multi-UAV path planning model involving multi-objective optimization is established, and the designed algorithm is simulated and compared with other three high-dimensional multi-objective optimization algorithms. The results show that the AEMO-EDA proposed in this paper has stronger convergence and wider population distribution diversity in applying to the multi-UAV cooperative path planning model, as well as better global convergence. The algorithm can provide an stable path for each UAV and promote the intelligent operation of the UAV system.  © 2013 IEEE.","collaborative path planning; estimation of distribution algorithms; evolutionary algorithm; multi-objective optimization; Multiple UAVs","Antennas; Covariance matrix; Heuristic algorithms; Motion planning; Multiobjective optimization; Three dimensional computer graphics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Collaborative path planning; Distribution algorithms; Estimation of distribution algorithm; Estimation of distributions; Evolutionary Multi-objectives; Multi UAV; Multi-objectives optimization; Multiple UAVs; Optimisations; Social factor; Evolutionary algorithms","Z.

Given the paths of UAVs, metaheuristic algorithms are explored to allocate searching time of UAVs, which are hard to guarantee the optimal solution for time allocation. In this paper, a novel searchinG timE allocatioN undEr coopeRative pAth pLaning (GENERAL) is proposed to solve the optimal solution of the time allocation given paths of UAVs. GENERAL adopts a semi-greedy construction and a repair procedure to initialize and amend the routing solutions during iterations. Motivated by the Newton’s method from convex optimization domains, we introduce a new Perturbed Parametric Nonlinear Complementarity Problem function (PPNCP-function), which reformulates the time allocation problem as a smoothing system of equations according to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theorem. Then a smoothing Newton method is introduced to obtain the optimal time allocation solution with superlinear convergence. Experimental results empirically indicate the GENERAL’s effectiveness compared to Ant Colony Optimization with Simulated Annealing (ACO-SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Besides, some numerical results indicate that the smoothing Newton method with PPNCP function is promising. The emerging aspects of this paper include: 1) it integrates the path planning with time allocation problem for maximizing the information collection reward; 2) a new PPNCP-function and a smoothing Newton method have been proposed to solve the optimal time allocation under path planning of UAVs; 3) the theoretical convergence analysis of the smoothing Newton method has been provided in this paper. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The constant development in this field allows us to go beyond the manual control and the use of a single UAV. In the context of inspection rules, this research provides new inputs to the multilevel approach used today and to the methods of structural inspection with drones. Today, UAV-based inspections are limited by manual and/or semi-automatic control with many restrictions on trajectory settings, especially for areas of difficult access with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) denied that still require the intervention of a human operator. This work proposes the use of autonomous navigation with a fleet of UAVs for infrastructural inspections. Starting from a digital twin, a solution is provided to problems such as the definition of a set of reference trajectories and the design of a position controller.

Path planning is a fundamental aspect of this endeavor. Works in the current literature assume that data are always ready to be retrieved when the UAV passes. This operational model is quite rigid and does not allow for the integration of the UAV as a computational object playing an active role in the network. In fact, the UAV could begin the computation on a first visit and retrieve the data later. Potentially, the UAV could orchestrate the distributed computation to improve its performance, change its parameters, and even upload new applications to the sensor network. In this paper, we analyze a scenario where a UAV plays an active role in the operation of multiple sensor networks by visiting different node clusters to initiate distributed computation and collect the final outcomes. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing total flight time, Average Age of Information, Average cluster computation end time, and Average data collection time compared to prevalent approaches to UAV path-planning that are adapted to the purpose. © 2022 by the authors.","distributed computing; UAV; UAV path planning; UAV task scheduling; UAV-supported IoT systems for smart cities; UAV–WSN integration","Antennas; Data acquisition; Distributed computer systems; Internet of things; Motion planning; Sensor nodes; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Sensor networks integration; Tasks scheduling; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicle path planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle task scheduling; Unmanned aerial vehicle-supported IoT system for smart city; Unmanned aerial vehicle–wireless sensor network integration; Vehicle path planning; Smart city","D.

Second, the related models of communication energy consumption between WSNs' network and UAV cluster, UAV cluster task allocation, and path planning are established successively.

In this article, based on the evaluator set, a mission planning framework for the underlying energy-efficient passive UAV radar imaging system is proposed to achieve optimized mission performance for a given remote sensing task. First, the mission planning problem is defined in the context of the proposed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system and a general framework is outlined, including mission specification, illuminator selection, and path planning. It is found that the performance of the system is highly dependent upon the flight path adopted by the UAV platform in a 3-D terrain environment, which offers the potential of optimizing the mission performance by adjusting the UAV path. Then, the path planning problem is modeled as a single-objective optimization problem with multiple constraints. Path planning can be divided into two substages based on different mission orientations and low mutual correlation. Based on this property, a path planning method, called substage division collaborative search (Sub-DiCoS), is proposed. The problem is divided into two subproblems with the corresponding decision space and subpopulation, which significantly relax the constraints for each subproblem and facilitates the search for feasible solutions. Then, differential evolution and the whole-stage best guidance technique are devised to cooperatively lead the subpopulations to search for the best solution. Finally, simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sub-DiCoS method. The result of the mission planning method can be used to guide the UAV platform to safely travel through a 3-D rough terrain in an energy-efficient manner and achieve optimized SAR imaging and communication performance during the flight.  © 2022 IEEE.","Differential evolution (DE); illuminators of opportunity; mission planning; substage division; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Energy efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Imaging systems; Motion planning; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Differential Evolution; Illuminator of opportunity; Mission planning; Optimisations; Search problem; Sub-stage divisions; Synthetic aperture radar; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicle .; Optimization","J.

Vitally, UAVs are capable of autonomous navigation, which means they can be used to plan safe paths to target positions in dangerous surroundings. Traditional path-planning algorithms do not perform well when the environmental state is dynamic and partially observable. It is difficult for a UAV to make the correct decision with incomplete information. In this study, we proposed a multi-UAV path planning algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning which entails the adoption of centralized training–decentralized execution architecture to coordinate all the UAVs. Additionally, we introduced a hidden state of the recurrent neural network to utilize the historical observation information. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem, We designed a joint reward function to guide UAVs to learn optimal policies under the multiple constraints. The results demonstrate that by using our method, we were able to solve the problem of incomplete information and low efficiency caused by partial observations and sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, and we realized kdiff multi-UAV cooperative autonomous path planning in unknown environment. © 2022 by the authors.","incomplete information; multi-objective; multi-UAV; path planning; reinforcement learning","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Motion planning; Reconnaissance aircraft; Recurrent neural networks; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Autonomous navigation; Incomplete information; Multi objective; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle; Path-planning algorithm; Reconnaissance mission; Reinforcement learning method; Reinforcement learnings; Target position; Reinforcement learning","Q.

However, apart from their extremely high cost, these sensors may be obscured by obstacles, which makes them impractical for many complex scenarios. Besides, most of the existing works for path planning have not considered energy efficiency for UGVs that are usually constrained by limited on-board batteries. Distinct from existing methods, this work presents a vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cooperative system for multiple UGVs. The proposed system harnesses the broad vision of UAV and operates in both general outdoor and global positioning system (GPS)-denied indoor environments. In sharp contrast to the conventional heuristic algorithms such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm and the Dijkstra methods, the proposed energy-efficient path planning for UGVs is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem by considering the collision-aware obstacle-avoidance. More specifically, the proposed path-planning scheme contains two stages, namely the semantic segmentation that localizes UGVs and obstacles in the environment by exploiting the wide-angle camera mounted on the UAV, followed by the trajectory generation in which a disciplined convex and concave programming (DCCP) algorithm is devised for the non-convex energy-minimization problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the UAV-UGV cooperative system and the proposed DCCP-based path-planning scheme.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Disciplined convex-concave programming; path planning; semantic segmentation; UAV-UGV cooperative system","Antennas; Cameras; Convex optimization; Energy efficiency; Global positioning system; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Image segmentation; Intelligent robots; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Motion planning; Robot programming; Trees (mathematics); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Concave programming; Cooperative systems; Disciplined convex-concave programming; Heuristics algorithm; Images segmentations; Planning scheme; Research interests; Semantic segmentation; Unmanned aerial vehicle-unmanned ground vehicle cooperative system; Semantics","L.

This is a complex optimization problem where task allocation and path planning are dealt with separately. However, the recalculation of optimal results is too slow for real-time operations in dynamic environments due to a large amount of computation required, and traditional algorithms are difficult to handle scenarios of varying scales. Meanwhile, the traditional approach confines task planning to a 2D environment, which deviates from the real world. In this paper, we design a 3D dynamic environment and propose a method for task planning based on sequence-to-sequence multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (SMADDPG) algorithm. First, we construct the task-planning problem as a multi-agent system based on the Markov decision process. Then, the DDPG is combined sequence-to-sequence to learn the system to solve task assignment and path planning simultaneously according to the corresponding reward function. We compare our approach with the traditional reinforcement learning algorithm in this system. The simulation results show that our approach satisfies the task-planning requirements and can accomplish tasks more efficiently in competitive as well as cooperative scenarios with dynamic or constant scales. © 2022 by the authors.","3D dynamic environment; deep deterministic policy gradient; multi-agent reinforcement learning; multi-UAV; sequence to sequence; task planning","","C.

Therefore, under the premise of covering all monitoring targets by UAVs, it is necessary to improve the monitoring frequency of the target and the privacy protection of the monitoring intention as much as possible. In response to the above problems, this research proposes monitoring overdue time to evaluate the monitoring frequency and monitoring period entropy in order to evaluate the ability to ensure monitoring privacy protection. It then establishes a multi-UAV cooperative persistent monitoring path planning model. In addition, the multi-group ant colony optimization algorithm, called overdue-aware multiple ant colony optimization (OMACO), is improved based on the monitoring overdue time. Finally, an optimal flight path for multi-UAV monitoring with high monitoring frequency and strong privacy preservation of monitoring intention is obtained. The simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the monitoring frequency of each monitoring node and the privacy preservation of the UAV monitoring path and has great significance for enhancing security monitoring and preventing intrusion. © 2022 by the authors.","monitoring frequency; overdue time; path planning; persistent monitoring; privacy protection","","Y.

The target is cooperative, and its position, heading, and speed are precisely known. The pursuing UAV has nonholonomic motion constraints, and therefore the path traveled must satisfy the minimum turn radius constraints. We consider the class of Dubins paths as candidate solutions, and analyze the characteristics of the six modes of Dubins paths where the final position is restricted to lie on the target circle with heading in the tangential direction of the circle. For each Dubins mode, we derive the feasibility limits, discontinuities, and local extrema. Using this analysis the intercepting paths are found by a systematic bisection search in the feasible regions of each of the Dubins modes. We prove that the algorithm finds the optimal (shortest length) intercepting path if it is a Dubins path. If the shortest intercepting path is not a Dubins path for any given instance, the algorithm finds a tight lower bound and an upper bound to the optimal solution. © 2022, AIAA International.

Different from existing works using UAVs for video surveillance, this paper employs a UAV team to carry out collaborative radio surveillance on ground moving nodes and disguise the purpose of surveillance. We consider two aspects of disguise. The first is that the UAVs do not communicate with each other (or the ground nodes can notice), and each UAV plans its trajectory in a decentralized way. The other aspect of disguise is that the UAVs avoid being noticed by the nodes for which a metric quantifying the disguising performance is adopted. We present a new decentralized method for the online trajectory planning of the UAVs, which maximizes the disguising metric while maintaining uninterrupted surveillance and avoiding UAV collisions. Based on the model predictive control (MPC) technique, our method allows each UAV to separately estimate the locations of the UAVs and the ground nodes, and decide its trajectory accordingly. The impact of potential estimation errors is mitigated by incorporating the error bounds into the online trajectory planning, hence achieving a robust control of the trajectories. Computer-based simulation results demonstrate that the developed strategy ensures the surveillance requirement without losing disguising performance, and outperforms existing alternatives. Note to Practitioners - The paper is motivated by the covertness requirement in the radio surveillance (also called eavesdropping) by UAVs. In some situations, the UAV user (such as the police department) wishes to disguise the surveillance intention from the targets, and the trajectories of UAVs play a significant role in the disguising. However, the typical UAV trajectories such as standoff tracking and orbiting can easily be noticed by the targets. Considering this gap, we focus on how to plan the UAVs' trajectories so that they are less noticeable while conducting effective eavesdropping. We formulate a path planning problem aiming at maximizing a disguising metric, which measures the magnitude of the relative position change between a UAV and a target. A decentralized method is proposed for the online trajectory planning of the UAVs based on MPC, and its robust version is also presented to account for the uncertainty in the estimation and prediction of the nodes' states. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","decentralized control; model predictive control (MPC); radio surveillance; trajectory planning; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); Wireless communications","Antennas; Error analysis; Model predictive control; Monitoring; Robust control; Security systems; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aerial vehicle; Decentralised control; Eavesdropping; Model predictive control; Model-predictive control; Radio surveillance; Surveillance; Trajectory Planning; Trajectory planning.; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Wireless communications; Signal to noise ratio","H.

In the process of cooperative stealth of UAV swarm formation control, the UAV swarm is treated as a three-dimensional sparse array, and the radar cross section (RCS) of the UAV swarm can be controlled by adjusting the space coordinates of each UAV. The functional relationship between the detection probability of radar and the RCS of the UAV swarm is also studied. The detection probability and range of radar can be reduced by aligning the detection radar to the lower RCS direction, which can be used to improve the trajectory planning of the UAV swarm. In this paper, the trajectory planning problem is described as a multi-objective optimization problem, and an ant colony algorithm is used to optimize and simulate the trajectory path of UAV swarm to achieve the shortest path and lowest detection probability of UAV swarm. The simulation results show that the cooperative stealth based on formation control can effectively shorten the trajectory length of UAV swarm, and greatly reduce the detection probability of radar in the process of penetration. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Radar cross section (RCS); Sparse array; Trajectory planning; UAV swarm","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Multiobjective optimization; Probability; Radar cross section; Tracking radar; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Battlefield environments; Detection probabilities; Formation control; Radar cross section; Radar cross-sections; Sparse arrays; Swarm formation; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm; Ant colony optimization","Y.

The “Ten-der” is equipped to flexibly and economically monitor and manage multiple diverse UAVs over otherwise inaccessible terrain through wireless communication. The proposed architecture enables operations and analysis supported by the means to de-tect, assess, and accommodate change and hazards on the spot with effective human observation and coordination. Further, this paper seeks to find the optimal trajectories for UAVs to collect data from sensors in a predefined continuous space. We formulate the path-planning problem for a cooperative, and a diverse swarm of UAVs tasked with optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously with the goal of maximizing accumulated data within a given flight time within cloud data processing constraints as well as minimizing the probable imposed risk during UAVs mission. The risk assessment model determines risk indicators using an integrated Specific Operation Risk Assessment —Bayesian belief network approach, while its resultant analysis is weighted through the analytic hierarchy process ranking model. To this end, as the problem is formulated as a convex optimization model, and we propose a low complexity multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm with a provable performance guarantee to solve the problem efficiently. We show that the MORL architecture can be successfully trained and allows each UAV to map each observation of the network state to an action to make optimal movement decisions. This proposed network architecture enables the UAVs to balance multiple objectives. Estimated MSE measures show that the algorithm produced decreasing errors in the learning process with increasing epoch number. © 2023 The Author(s).","Bayesian belief network; LIDAR sensor; multi-objective reinforcement algorithm; trajectory optimization; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Bayesian networks; Convex optimization; Data handling; Learning algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Network architecture; Optical radar; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Data network; LIDAR sensors; Multi objective; Multi-objective reinforcement algorithm; Multiple-objectives; Reinforcement algorithms; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Trajectory optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Risk assessment","A.

The established multi-sensor joint indoor positioning model introduces inertial sensor data information on the basis of the Wi-Fi positioning model. This article uses Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to establish a motion trajectory model, which improves the accuracy of indoor positioning and anti-interference ability, so that it can still maintain good positioning accuracy in a complex indoor environment. The basic modeling of UAV trajectory planning is studied. We analyze the physical performance and planning environment of the UAV, and transform the problem into a mathematical function. In the realization of the planning algorithm, the road sign guidance method is used to solve the local trap problem of the velocity vector field. We research on the UAV constraint fusion method, and use the ""detection step method"" to solve the UAV minimum turning radius constraint fusion problem. By setting the distance between the wall-climbing robot and the UAV formation relationship and introducing the speed of avoiding other UAVs, the trajectory collision-free constraint fusion is realized. On this basis, two coordination mechanisms of temporary target selection and detection step adjustment are designed to realize the coordination of the trajectory of the wall-climbing robot and the UAV in different scenarios. We study environment update methods and adopt partial update strategies to realize the processing of planning space update, task update, and threat update, so as to ensure that the algorithm can be applied to a dynamically changing environment. The design of the planning algorithm was completed, the track evaluation index was proposed, and the simulation verification software was developed to complete the verification of the algorithm’s feasibility, rationality, completeness, and rapidity. The effects of adding threats and deleting threats during the planning process on the coordinated trajectory planning of wall-climbing robots and UAVs are studied. In both cases, the wall-climbing robot and the UAV can avoid the threat area and reach their respective target points in coordination. It can be seen that the local update mechanism of the environment can quickly and effectively respond to the dynamic change of the threat, which not only ensures the speed of the algorithm. It also ensures that wall-climbing robots and drones can safely avoid dynamic threats, effectively realizing the collaboration allowed by the environment. © The Author(’s).","collaborative constraint; multi-sensor; unmanned aerial vehicle; wall-climbing robot","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Computer software; Dynamics; Mathematical transformations; Mobile robots; Robot programming; Trajectories; Verification; Aerial vehicle; Collaborative constraint; Control applications; Cooperative control technology; Indoor positioning; Multi sensor; Planning algorithms; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Wall climbing robot; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","X.

Based on the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method, the algorithm optimizes the attractive potential field function and the repulsive potential field function. Besides, this paper adds both a priority collision avoidance strategy between UAVs and temporary virtual target strategy. This algorithm not only improves the success rate of path planning, but also considers the collision problem when multiple UAVs cooperate to complete the task. The experimental simulation results show that, compared with the traditional APF method, the algorithm can accurately and effectively complete the path planning task in the complex obstacle environment, and realize the collaborative path planning of multi- UAV formations at the same time.  © 2023 IEEE.","artificial potential field; collision avoidance; path planning; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Antennas; Collision avoidance; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 3-D environments; Aerial vehicle; Artificial potential fields; Artificial potential fields method; Collisions avoidance; Field function; Obstacle collision; Obstacles avoidance; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle path planning; Motion planning","S.

This paper considers using collaborative UAVs (Col-UAV) to execute such tasks. It proposes to plan efficient trajectories for multiple UAVs to collaboratively maximize the number of devices to cover within minimized flying time. The proposed reinforcement learning (RL)-based Col-UAV scheme lets all UAVs share their traveling information by maintaining a common Q-table, which reduces the overall time and the memory complexities. We simulate the proposed RL Col-UAV scheme under various simulation environments with different grid sizes and compare the performance with other baselines.

The problem of online trajectory planning is essentially a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem. To solve this problem, a dynamic multi-objective evolutionry algorithm based on decomposition-adaptive reaction mechanism selection (MOEA/D-ARMS) is proposed. A variety of response mechanisms constitute a response mechanism pool. The response mechanism is given a certain reward based on the most recent overall performance of the response mechanism, and the response mechanism is selected from the response mechanism pool using a probability-based method. MOEA/D-ARMS is applied to four simulation instances, such as static environment instance, sudden threat instance, mutation threat instance and preference change instance.

However, as the number and degree of the path threats increases, the recent UCAV path planning algorithms all suffer from being trapped into local optima with a low convergence rate, which leads to the poor performance. Therefore, to resolve these problems, we propose a Cooperative co-Evolution (CE)-based Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) algorithm, named CESMO to address UCAV path planning problem for avoiding obstacles. First, a cooperative co-evolution strategy is proposed to prevent the algorithms from falling into local optima easily, enhancing the coherence of the path. After that, a further division is applied to the algorithm for diversifying the search direction of each individual in the sub-groups. Finally, the spider monkey optimization-based search mechanism is designed to further strengthen the search efficiency and boost the convergence rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is more competitive than other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms for UCAV path planning problem considering the quality and stability of the final paths. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cooperative co-evolution; Path planning; Spider monkey optimization; Unmanned combat aerial vehicle","Antennas; Evolutionary algorithms; Global optimization; Military vehicles; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Avoiding obstacle; Convergence rates; Cooperative co-evolution; Global optimization problems; Local optima; Optimisations; Path planning problems; Spider monkey optimization; Unmanned combat aerial vehicles; Vehicle path planning; Motion planning","Y.

However, existing researches ignore sensors are usually deployed in 3-D space, and a number of generated sensing data are dropped due to limited storage capacities of sensors. To solve the problem, we propose the A2E2 framework to ensure the sustainable sensing operation, i.e., collecting data and charging sensors assisted by UAVs in IPTS simultaneously. In A2E2 framework, UAVs could charge sensors and fly near them to collect sensing data. Meanwhile, they also could stop on vehicles to be charged and send collected data to smart services. The entire process is formulated as a collaborative task allocation and scheduling jointly optimization problem. We solve the problem by dividing it into two parts which are proved NP-hard, and propose two algorithms, i.e., the minimum transfer algorithm and shortest trajectory planning algorithm. The minimum transfer algorithm minimizes the number of UAV transfer times among vehicles, and the shortest trajectory planning algorithm ensures UAVs could execute the allocated task effectively.

For solving the collaborative path planning problem of a UAV cluster in a dynamic obstacle environment, in this paper, an adaptive risk-free method is proposed for multiple UAVs to design coordinated trajectory with environment adaptability. The method integrates a type of Q-learning algorithm, which is risk free for its awareness of risk avoidance, and dynamic window approach, which can generate adaptability to dynamic changes of environmental risks. Built on the Reynold cluster model to describe a generalized UAV cooperative motion mathematically and designed with the principle of repulsion to ensure the safety of the cluster, a typical task of multi-UAV risk-free movement is established to verify the proposed coordinated path planning method. The simulation results have demonstrated that during the entire process, the cluster keeps a safe distance from dynamic obstacles, showing effectiveness of security and coordination and strong adaptability to the dynamic obstacle environment. © 2022, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.","Coordinated path planning; Dynamic obstacle environment; Reinforcement learning; Risk-free Q-learning; UAV cluster","","Y.

The re-cent appreciation of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) arises from its success in navigation prob-lems, but due to the competitiveness and complexity of the military field, the applications of DRL in the military field are still unsatisfactory. In this paper, an end-to-end DRL-based intelligent reconnaissance mission planning is proposed for dual unmanned aerial vehicle (dual UAV) cooperative reconnaissance missions under high-threat and dense situations. Comprehensive consideration is given to specific mission properties and parameter requirements through the whole modelling. Firstly, the reconnaissance mission is described as a Markov decision process (MDP), and the mission planning model based on DRL is established. Secondly, the environment and UAV motion parameters are standardized to input the neural network, aiming to deduce the difficulty of algorithm convergence. According to the concrete requirements of non-reconnaissance by radars, dual-UAV cooperation and wandering reconnaissance in the mission, four reward functions with weights are designed to enhance agent understanding to the mission. To avoid sparse reward, the clip function is used to control the reward value range. Finally, considering the continuous action space of reconnaissance mission planning, the widely applicable proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used in this paper. The simulation is carried out by combining offline training and online planning. By changing the location and number of ground detection areas, from 1 to 4, the model with PPO can maintain 20% of reconnaissance proportion and a 90% mission complete rate and help the reconnaissance UAV to complete efficient path planning. It can adapt to unknown continuous high-dimensional environmental changes, is generalizable, and reflects strong intelligent planning performance. © 2022 by the authors.

The strategy is proposed with the vehicle kinematic constraint, the collision constraint of UAVs, and the space-time cooperative constraint. With the proposed strategy, the collision constraint can be solved. What's more, with the strategy, the resistibility of the UAVs to the recovery system of the target can be improved, and the chance of survival can be increased. A rapid path planning method for multiple UAVs with space cooperative requirements is proposed. The Dubins curve is combined in the method, and the exponential increment of computation with the number of UAVs is transformed intoa polynomial form. The real-time requirement can be satisfied with the method, and sub-optimal trajectories can be generated. Simulation and flight experiments are carried out, and the results show that the UAVs can be guided to the target with the generated paths effectively, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. © 2022 Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA).

Firstly, the respective functions of UAV and vehicle in the inspection process should be defined, and their respective flight and driving rules should be defined according to the characteristics of their functions. On this basis, the cooperative mode between them and the path characteristics under cooperative constraints should be further considered. The TSP-D model for transmission tower inspection (TTI-TSP-D) is constructed by reducing time consumption through collaborative parallelism and taking the total time required for inspection as the objective function. Therefore, we use genetic algorithm to solve the above model. By analyzing the characteristics of cooperative path planning problems and models, we propose odd-even layered coding to realize the transformation from problem space to chromosome space, and design matching crossover mode, mutation mode, solution test and infeasible solution correction mode. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is analyzed from multiple angles through simulation experiments, The correctness of the algorithm is verified by comparing it with enumeration algorithm in small-scale test cases, and the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with conventional strategies in different scale tests.

UAV swarms are suggested as a promising solution to cope with the issues that may arise when connecting Internet of Things (IoT) applications to a fog platform. We are interested in a crucial aspect of designing a swarm of UAVs in this work, which is the coordination of swarm agents in complicated and unknown environments. Centralized leader–follower formations are one of the most prevalent architectural designs in the literature. In the event of a failed leader, however, the entire mission is canceled. This paper proposes a framework to enable the use of UAVs under different MEC architectures, overcomes the drawbacks of centralized architectures, and improves their overall performance. The most significant contribution of this research is the combination of distributed formation control, online leader election, and collaborative obstacle avoidance. For the initial phase, the optimal path between departure and arrival points is generated, avoiding obstacles and agent collisions. Next, a quaternion-based sliding mode controller is designed for formation control and trajectory tracking. Moreover, in the event of a failed leader, the leader election phase allows agents to select the most qualified leader for the formation. Multiple possible scenarios simulating real-time applications are used to evaluate the framework. The obtained results demonstrate the capability of UAVs to adapt to different MEC architectures under different constraints. Lastly, a comparison is made with existing structures to demonstrate the effectiveness, safety, and durability of the designed framework. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; formation control; leader election; Mobile Edge Computing; multi-agent systems; obstacle avoidance; path planning; UAV","Antennas; Internet of things; Mobile edge computing; Motion planning; Network architecture; Sliding mode control; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Centralised; Computing architecture; Formation control; Leader election; Obstacles avoidance; Planning controls; Swarm agents; Unknown environments; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Multi agent systems","S.

In the planning process, the complex 3D space structure increases the difficulty of solving the trajectory points, and the mutual constraints of the UAV cooperative constraints can degrade the performance of the planning system. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of MUCTP, this study proposes MUCTP based on feasible domain space and adaptive differential evolution algorithm (FDS-ADEA). The method first constructs a three-dimensional feasible domain space to reduce the complexity of the search space structure; then, the constraints of heterogeneous UAVs are linearly weighted and transformed into a new objective function, and the information of the fitness value is shared in accordance with the adaptive method and the code correction method to improve the search efficiency of the algorithm; finally, the trajectories are smoothed to ensure the flyability of the UAVs performing the mission by combining the cubic B-spline curves.

UAVs provide a broad view and have a fast speed in the air, while UGVs have sufficient load capacity and can serve as repeater stations on the ground. The path planning of a UAV/UGV cooperative system is an important but difficult issue, which aims to plan paths for both the UAVs and the UGVs in the system to cooperatively complete a mission. In this article, we consider the path planning problem of the UAV/UGV cooperative system for illegal urban building detection, by taking the limits of UGV speed, UAV load power, and UAV/UGV communication restriction into consideration. To solve this problem, we first model the path planning problem as a constraint optimization problem which tries to minimize an overall execution time for completing the illegal urban building detection tasks, and then propose a two-level memetic algorithm (called Two-MA) to solve the path planning problems of both the UAV and the UGV. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets show the superiority of the proposed Two-MA over several states-of-the-art algorithms in solving the path planning problems of the UAV and UGV for illegal urban building detection tasks. Note to Practitioners - This article was motivated by the task of detecting illegal buildings in cities by unmanned vehicles. Previous works mainly focus on path planning of either UAVs or UGVs in this task. This article proposes a new approach using an Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) cooperative system for detecting illegal buildings in parks, by taking the limits of UGV speed, UAV load power, and UAV/UGV communication restriction into consideration. This cooperative system consists of a UAV, UGV, and control center. The UAV equipped with cameras takes aerial photography in the air, and can transmit collected photos to the control center. The UGV executes loading and transportation on the ground, and can serve as takeoff and landing platforms for the UAV. The control center executes computationally intensive tasks such as data transmission and processing, task scheduling, and vehicle coordination. To quickly complete all detection tasks, a memetic algorithm is proposed for path planning of both the UAV and the UGV. The simulated results show that the proposed algorithm enables the UAV/UGV cooperative system to visit all buildings in cities with a minimum task execution time.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Cooperative detection systems; illegal urban building detection; memetic algorithm; path planning; unmanned air/ground vehicle (UAV/UGV)","Aircraft detection; Buildings; Constrained optimization; Cooperative communication; Crime; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Urban planning; Air grounds; Building detection; Cooperative detection; Cooperative detection system; Cooperative systems; Detection system; Illegal urban building detection; Memetic; Memetic algorithms; Optimisations; Task analysis; Unmanned air; Unmanned air/ground vehicle (UAV/UGV).; Urban areas; Urban buildings; Motion planning","L.

The latest imitation augmented DRL (IADRL) model has achieved good performance for the cooperative transportation tasks of automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, this model cannot always transport target cargoes with the optimized policy due to premature convergence. Therefore, we propose an intelligent path planning model for AGV-UAV transportation in this paper. The proposed model utilizes the proximal policy optimization with covariance matrix adaptation (PPO-CMA) in the imitation learning and DRL networks, which enables the AGV-UAV coalition to plan the optimal transportation route at a lower cost.

This method organically combines the situation assessment of single UAV with the collaborative optimization of multiple UAV. On the one hand, the situation assessment of single UAV is carried out based on Bayesian network, and the striking probability of each UAV is obtained. On the other hand, in order to solve the problem of multiple UAV cooperation, the improved discrete particle swarm optimization based mixed strategy (MSDPSO) is proposed. The algorithm has been improved in the following four aspects. Firstly, Sobol sequence is used to initialize the population to improve the coverage of solution space. Then, a nonlinear time-varying strategy is proposed to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Cauchy operator is also introduced to enhance the search space of discrete particle swarm optimization. At the same time, an adaptive cross learning strategy is proposed to enrich the diversity of the population, thereby improving the global optimization ability of the algorithm. In addition, the cubic spline interpolation is used to plan trajectory of UAV. Finally, improved discrete particle swarm optimization is used in three-dimensional space for simulation and comparison with both healthy and faulty UAV involved. Results show that the designed algorithm has significant improvement on solution optimality and convergence rate, which provides a theoretical basis for the application of multiple UAV collaborative task planning.  © 2013 IEEE.","Bayesian network; cubic spline interpolation; improved DPSO; Multi-UAV coordination","Antennas; Bayesian networks; Global optimization; Interpolation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Bayes method; Bayesia n networks; Cubic-spline interpolation; Improved DPSO; Multi UAV; Multi-UAV coordination; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Resource management; Swarm optimization; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Y.

The efficient path planning is used to identify the main cause of disaster like bushfires that are badly affecting the forest ecosystem throughout the globe. This novel approach is a first step toward a predisaster assessment and possibilities to save the survivors in minimal time. Different metaheuristic algorithms, such as PSO, GWO, WOA, BMO, and DGBCO, are compared for UAV path optimization capability. In order to test the robustness of our proposed model, four different scenarios are presented which include general environment, condense environment, maze environment, and dynamic environment. In each scenario, the obstacles are placed in such a way to increase the overall path complexity for a UAV to reach the destination. The exploration and exploitation groups working simultaneously in a dynamic environment make it effective for UAV path planning using the DGBCO algorithm. Based on the parameters selected, the DGBCO algorithm outperforms other algorithms and achieves 24.5% less transportation cost and 13.3% less computational time.

Therefore, it is important to consider the collaborative learning among UAVs when designing collaborative strategies. This paper analyzes the problems of existing value-decomposition-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in multi-UAV area search and path planning, namely the underestimation of optimal joint actions, which leads to suboptimal policy generation. Subsequently, a new non-monotonicity value-decomposition algorithm is proposed based on the addition of a masked highway connection strategy. This algorithm suppresses the optimization of certain action pairs and focuses more on the optimal joint actions, thus better optimizing the objective and recovering the value of optimal joint actions.

Existing studies have mainly transformed this problem into a single-objective optimization problem using a single metric to evaluate multi-UAV trajectory planning methods. However, multi-UAV trajectory planning evolves into a many-objective optimization problem due to the complexity of the demand and the environment. Therefore, a multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning model based on many-objective optimization is proposed to optimize trajectory distance, trajectory time, trajectory threat, and trajectory coordination distance costs of UAVs. The NSGA-III algorithm, which overcomes the problems of traditional trajectory planning, is used to solve the model.

To address this problem, a novel hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, namely, SDPSO, is proposed in this article. The proposed algorithm improves the update strategy of the global optimal solution in the PSO algorithm by merging the simulated annealing algorithm, which enhances the optimization ability and avoids falling into local convergence; each particle integrates the beneficial information of the optimal solution according to the dimensional learning strategy, which reduces the phenomenon of particles oscillation during the evolution process and increases the convergence speed of the SDPSO algorithm. The simulation results show that compared with PSO, dynamic-group-based cooperative optimization (DGBCO), gray wolf optimizer (GWO), RPSO, and two-swarm learning PSO (TSLPSO), the SDPSO algorithm can quickly plan higher quality paths for UAVs and has better robustness in complex 3-D environments.  © 2014 IEEE.","Hybrid algorithm; particle swarm optimization (PSO); path planning; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Motion planning; Optimal systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Simulated annealing; Three dimensional displays; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Convergence; Heuristics algorithm; Hybrid algorithms; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; Three-dimensional display; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Heuristic algorithms","X.

In this paper, we consider a JRC-enabled multi-UAV cooperative detection scenario, in which each UAV equipped with a JRC unit simultaneously performs the detection function to sense multiple targets and the communication function to transmit the detected data to a fusion center. To strike a trade-off between radar sensory and communication performance for all UAVs, we optimize the transmit power, resource allocation and navigation for each UAV to maximize their sensing scores and the geographical fairness of the targets on the condition of the quality requirements of communication and radar sensing. This problem is a mixed integer non-convex optimization that is challenging to be solved in practice. Considering the complexity of the optimization and dynamics of the UAV environment, we design a learning based trajectory planning and resource allocation (LTPRA) algorithm that leverages multiple learning agents to find effective policies from experiences while guaranteeing communication and sensing performance. To improve the environmental exploration of agents, we design an incentive mechanism for their detection behavior and introduce a policy regularization method to mitigate policy overfitting in multi-agent cooperation. Numerical results reveal the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm and show the improvement on detection and communication performance in JRC-enabled multi-UAV detection systems compared with state-of-the-art approaches.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Joint radar and communication; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; multi-UAV trajectory design; resource allocation","Aircraft detection; Convex optimization; Cooperative communication; Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Integer programming; Multi agent systems; Resource allocation; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Communication performance; Cooperative detection; Joint radar and communication; Multi agent; Multi UAV; Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; Multi-UAV trajectory design; Reinforcement learnings; Resources allocation; Trajectory designs; Reinforcement learning","S.

In this paper, a novel hierarchical solution strategy, named as the Homogenization-Planning-Tracking (HPT) method, to solve cooperative autonomous motion control for heterogeneous carrier dispatch systems is developed. In the homogenization layer, any towed aircraft system involved in the sortie task is abstracted into a virtual taxiing aircraft. This layer transforms the heterogeneous systems into a homogeneous configuration. Then in the planning layer, a centralized optimal control problem is formulated for the homogeneous system. Compared with conducting the path planning directly with the original heterogeneous system, the homogenization layer contributes to reduce the dimension and nonlinearity of the formulated optimal control problem in the planning layer and consequently improves the robustness and efficiency of the solution process. Finally, in the tracking layer, a receding horizon controller is developed to track the reference trajectory obtained in the planning layer. To improve the tracking performance, multi-objective optimization techniques are implemented offline in advance to determine optimal weight parameters used in the tracking layer. Simulations demonstrate that smooth and collision-free cooperative trajectory can be generated efficiently in the planning phase. And robust trajectory tracking can be realized in the presence of external disturbances in the tracking phase. The developed HPT method provides a promising solution to the autonomous deck dispatch for unmanned carrier aircraft in the future. © 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics","Autonomous motion control; Carrier dispatch system; Cooperative trajectory planning; Heterogeneous system; Receding horizon control; Weight optimization","Aircraft control; Aircraft detection; Hierarchical systems; Motion control; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal control systems; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Autonomous motion control; Carrier dispatch system; Cooperative trajectory planning; Dispatch systems; Heterogeneous systems; Optimal control problem; Receding horizon control; Tracking method; Trajectory Planning; Weight optimization; Motion planning","X.

Mission capabilities increase while contingencies can be mitigated through intelligent management between the operating swarm and the available fleet. The importance of observing the system reliability and of risk assessment grows because the dysfunction of one asset within a system of systems endangers the superordinate mission goals of the operating UAV swarm. Thus, not only is trajectory planning beneficial for usage optimization, but prognostic and health management (PHM) methods, including diagnostics and prognostics, also enable situational awareness and condition-driven asset management to achieve higher mission reliability. The novelty of this work is the observation of asset states based upon a generically modeled multi-component degradation behavior and the integration of PHM methods with real-time capabilities in order to support decision making during mission execution in a highly dynamic and event-based environment.

It no longer meets the requirements of the Multi-UAV Cooperative Reconnaissance Mission Planning (MUCRMP) problem in the context of multi-radar detection. In this paper, a global optimisation model with the objective of a shorter distance within radar detection range of the UAV is proposed at first, including the planning of reconnaissance sequence between and within target groups, relative position to targets. More importantly, the imaging characteristics of the UAV and its minimum turning radius have been considered in depth in this study. Then an improved synthetic heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the model, which obtains valuable reconnaissance mission plan. Finally, an example solution for a problem with 68 target point sizes is carried out, and the validity and feasibility of the model and algorithm are illustrated through the analysis given.

To address this need, a novel framework is developed for computing optimized 4D trajectories for UAVs that ensure dynamic and flexible use of the airspace, while maximizing the available capacity through the minimization of the aggregate traveling times. Specifically, a network manager (NM) is utilized that considers UAV requests (including start/target locations) and addresses inherent mobility uncertainties using a linear-Gaussian system, to compute efficient and safe trajectories.

Identifying an effective path in an environment with various obstacles and ensuring that the path may efficiently cover the selected stop points for effective data collection are both necessary and difficult. We propose a UAV-based effective data gathering scheme for wireless sensor networks with obstacles, where a UAV is employed as a mobile sink to collect data from the ground sensor nodes (EDGO). The main novelty includes a UAV–WSN collaborative approach for data gathering, which incorporates a convenient method for UAV trajectory design in a three-dimensional environment with obstacles. We propose an improved heuristic evolutionary approach based on genetic algorithm to determine the optimized trajectory for the UAV to gather data. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed method focus to reduce the length and angle cost of the path, minimize the energy consumption, and delay, and includes different evolutionary operations to generate a collision free path for UAV. Our approach retains the infeasible path through sufficient modifications, which improves the diversity of paths, so that it is possible to jump out of the local optima. The results reveal the effectiveness of the EDGO scheme against the other related approaches in terms of path cost and data collection efficiency. The network lifetime is extended by approximately 11% and offers a reduction of 42% and 35% in the UAV path length and travel time, respectively, when compared to the existing schemes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data gathering; Genetic algorithm; Obstacle avoidance; Path planning heuristic; Trajectory design; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); Wireless sensor network (WSN)","Antennas; Collision avoidance; Data acquisition; Energy utilization; Motion planning; Sensor nodes; Trajectories; Travel time; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Data collection; Data gathering; Network operations; Obstacles avoidance; Path planning heuristic; Planning heuristics; Stop points; Trajectory designs; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Wireless sensor network; Genetic algorithms","P.V.

One of the most critical challenges for complex WSN applications is the huge computing demands and limited battery energy without any replenishment. The recent development of UAV-assisted cooperative computing technology provides a promising solution to overcome these shortcomings. This paper addresses a three-tier WSN model for UAV-assisted cooperative computing, which includes several sensor nodes, a moving UAV equipped with computing resources, and a sink node (SN). Computation tasks arrive randomly at each sensor node, and the UAV moves around above the sensor nodes and provides computing services. The sensor nodes can process the computation tasks locally or cooperate with the UAV or SN for computing. In a life cycle of the UAV, we aim to maximize the energy efficiency of cooperative computing by optimizing the UAV path planning on the constraints of node energy consumption and task deadline. To adapt to the time-varying indeterminate environment, a deep Q network- (DQN-) based path planning algorithm is proposed. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than the competitive algorithms, significantly improves the energy efficiency of cooperative computing, and achieves energy consumption balance.  © 2023 Zhihui Guo et al.","","Complex networks; Deep learning; Electromechanical devices; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Life cycle; MEMS; Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Sensor nodes; Complex applications; Computation tasks; Cooperative computing; Critical challenges; Energy efficient; Microelectromechanical-systems technologies; Multi-tier; Reinforcement learnings; Sink nodes; Wireless sensor network applications; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","H.

Therefore, a cable-driven parallel robot is a suitable choice for automated masonry construction. Another possible robotic system for this task consists of a set of cooperative drones, each connected to the end effector and the payload by a cable. Because of the similarities between the two robotic systems, the same object-oriented programmed software can be used for trajectory planning and subsequent investigations, making minor adjustments. The implemented optimizing path planning algorithm takes into account the physical boundaries, motion time, collision avoidance and energy requirements. Thus, a simulation-based comparison of the characteristics of both systems can be made. In this paper, the necessary physical models for both the drone system and the cable robot are derived in detail. Based on the common framework, this paper presents a comparison between the two robotic systems, defining two different scenarios. The first scenario demonstrates the functioning of the optimizer approach. The second scenario is used to compare the two systems. For this purpose, the trajectories for all 1720 masonry units of the first floor of a house are optimized. The analysis of the results shows that both systems can transport heavy loads, with the cable robot having advantages on smaller sites, while the drone system covers larger distances for the price of slower performance and higher energy consumption. © 2022 by the authors.","automated masonry; cable robot; construction automation; drone cooperation; modeling and simulation; numerical optimization; path planning; robotic construction","","R.

An unmanned reconnaissance mission for a target group (URMFTG) is a significant pattern in UAV cluster combat. This paper discusses the collaborative path planning problem of unmanned aerial vehicle formations (UAVFs) and refueling tankers in a URMFTG with threat areas and fuel constraints. The purpose of collaborative path planning is to ensure that the UAVFs (with fuel constraints) can complete the reconnaissance mission for the target group with the assistance of refueling tankers, which is one of the most important constraints in the collaborative path planning. In this paper, a collaborative path-planning model is designed to analyze the relationship between the planning path of the UAVFs and the tankers, and a threat avoidance strategy is designed considering the threat area. This paper proposes a two-stage solution algorithm. It creates a UAVFs path-planning algorithm based on the fast search genetic algorithm (FSGA) and a refueling tanker path-planning algorithm based on the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Based on simulation experiments, the solution method proposed in this paper can provide a better path-planning scheme for a URMFTG. That is, it decreases the rate of the UAVF’s distance growth from 3.1% to 2.2% for the path planning of UAVFs and provides a better Pareto solution set for the path planning of refueling tankers. © 2022 by the authors.","collaborative path planning; threat avoidance; two-stage solution algorithm; unmanned reconnaissance mission for the target group (URMFTG)","","Q.

In view of aforesaid practical problems, this paper proposes using MAXQ hierarchical reinforcement learning method to achieve dimensionality reduction by abstraction and combining leader-wingman approach with dynamic dead zone to model after cooperative formation and design triangular form. A novel algorithm based on MAXQ and simulated annealing is designed to solve unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning problem, which accomplishes grid method-based path planning simulation in 2D scenarios. A comparative analysis is performed on Q-Learning, ϵ-Q-Learning, standard MAXQ and SA-MAXQ algorithms in terms of their convergence, time consumption and search steps.

In order to realize the rapid response of post-disaster emergency response mapping, multi-UAV collaborative mapping scheme and optimization objectives are constructed, taking into account the constraints of emergency response mapping task demand, priority, geographic environment of task area and UAV mapping resource capacity, etc. The initial perception of the environment is completed through the pre-trajectory planning of multi-UAV, and multi-UAV collaborative trajectory planning based on PSO (particle swarm optimization) is proposed based on the perception information, so as to the problem of repeated data collection and collision between UAV in the process of multi-UAV flight is effectively avoided. © 2023 SPIE.","emergency response mapping; multi-UAV; particle swarm optimization; trajectory planning","Antennas; Emergency services; Image processing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Emergency response; Emergency response mapping; Environmental constraints; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; Trajectory Planning; Vehicle trajectories; Mapping","D.

Considering the urgency of disaster relief, a practical, accurate, and robust modeling method for multiple SUAVs deployments is vital. For this concern, this article first formalizes the deployment problem of multiple solar-powered UAVs in communication recovery by extending Group MultiRole Assignment (GMRA) (UGRA). In the second step, the success in this assignment process depends on the choice of the agent evaluation method. The evaluation benchmark in UGRA is SUAV path planning in a complex environment with uncertain subpaths and accumulative attitude errors. In response to this issue, we propose two innovative algorithms: 1) dynamic curve path-planning algorithm (DCPPA) and 2) greedy curved straight path-planning algorithm (GCSPPA). Moreover, with the time requirement in mind, one sufficient condition and one necessary condition are established to help the DCPPA achieve fast convergence. With these two novel agent evaluation algorithms, UGRA can rapidly deploy multiple SUAVs to establish a collaborative relay network within an acceptable time. Finally, simulation experiments at different scales are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed solution.  © 2013 IEEE.","Agent evaluation; disaster relief; dynamic curve path-planning algorithm (DCPPA); greedy curved straight path-planning algorithm (GCSPPA); group multirole assignment (GMRA); human-machine cooperation; the deployment of multiple solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) in communication recovery","Antennas; Computer system recovery; Disaster prevention; Emergency services; Heuristic algorithms; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Agent evaluation; Collaboration; Disaster relief; Dynamic curve path-planning algorithm; Greedy curved straight path-planning algorithm; Group multirole assignment; Heuristics algorithm; Human-machine cooperation; Multiroles; Path-planning algorithm; Relay network; Relay network (telecommunication); Solar-powered; Task analysis; The deployment of multiple solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle  in communication recovery; Recovery","D.

These applications include collaborative crop monitoring, aerial transportation, offshore delivery, facility monitoring, disaster relieve as well as search and rescue. Current UAV operations are heavily dependent on human operators that require each UAV to be controlled by dedicated safety pilot as well as a separate payload operator which limits the efficient use of UAVs required in envisaged swarm applications. Thus, there is an imperative to mature high autonomy guidance and navigation technologies to allow UAV swarm operations. This paper explores UAV swarm navigation and control strategies that allow higher levels of autonomy for a reliable UAV swarm operation. This paper presented the novel strategies developed in performing simultaneous swarm mapping, swarm search, and swarm path planning. The methods developed can be easily scaled up or down to adapt to different number of UAVs in a swarm for any application. The developed strategies are implemented and tested with Monte-Carlo simulations for a search and rescue type mission. The results from these simulation experiments have shown comparable achievements on the performance and robustness when compared to optimal control strategy. © 2023 IEEE.","","Aircraft control; Antennas; Control theory; Intelligent systems; Mapping; Monte Carlo methods; Motion planning; Offshore oil well production; Optimal control systems; Aerial transportation; Aerial vehicle; Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles; Crop monitoring; Disaster relieves; Facility monitoring; Human intervention; Localisation; Offshores; Search and rescue; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","IEEE Computer Society","1095323X","978-166549032-0","","","English","IEEE Aerosp.

However, various limitations such as the battery capacity, the charging method, and the flying range make it difficult for most applications to carry out routine tasks in vast areas. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for multi-UAV path planning that considers a cooperative action amongst UAVs in which they share the next destination to avoid visiting the same location at the same time. The Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN) enables UAVs to autonomously plan their fastest path and ensure the continuity of the mission by deciding when to schedule a visit to a charging station or a data collection point. An objective function with a tailored reward is designed to maintain the stability of the model and ensure the quick convergence of the model. Lastly, the proposed strategy has been demonstrated by the experiments on different scenarios and showed its effectiveness in ensuring the continuity of the mission with a fastest path possible.  © 2023 IEEE.","aerial data collection; deep reinforcement learning; smart health.; unmanned aerial vehicles; wireless power transfer; wireless sensor networks","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Charging (batteries); Data acquisition; Deep learning; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Energy transfer; Inductive power transmission; Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial data collection; Aerial vehicle; Data collection; Deep reinforcement learning; Disaster management; Fastest paths; Reinforcement learnings; Smart health.; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle path planning; Wireless sensor networks","A.

Aiming at the problem that the traditional combinatorial optimization algorithm needs to set up the global battlefield situation in advance, considering the consumability of resources in the attack process, the integrated search and attack task flow is established. Considering the communication restricted environment, the unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) are grouped, with centralized architecture within the group and distributed structure between the groups, and the corresponding distributed auction mechanism is constructed to achieve OWTA within the communication range limited. In order to solve the problem that it is difficult to ensure the time consistency of the coordinated attack target, a dubins cooperative path planning based on cooperative particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm is proposed. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to adjust the radius of the dubins path of each bomb, so that the uav in the same group can hit the target simultaneously without collision and have the shortest flight range. The simulation results show that the designed distributed auction algorithm takes into account the consumption of attack resources, and quickly redistributes the firepower to the new targets in the dynamic uncertain environment, which ensures the maximization of the execution efficiency of the multi-machine cluster fire allocation task.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Antennas; Clustering algorithms; Motion planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aerial vehicle; Assignment algorithms; Auctions mechanisms; Combinatorial optimization algorithm; Distributed Auctions; Large-scales; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Task flows; Unknown environments; Weapon-target assignment; Combinatorial optimization","M.

In this paper, a unified framework for onboard distributed trajectory planning is proposed, which takes full advantage of intelligent discrete and continuous search algorithms. Firstly, the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is used as the task allocation algorithm to solve the cooperative obstacle avoidance problem. Taking the task allocation decisions as the constraint, knowledge-based particle swarm optimization (Know-PSO) is used as the optimization algorithm to solve the onboard distributed cooperative trajectory planning problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed intelligent MCTS-PSO search framework is effective and flexible for multiple UAVs to conduct the cooperative trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance.

In this paper, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV)-UAV-enabled data collection system is studied, where data collection missions are conducted by a UAV and a UGV cooperatively. Two cooperative strategies are proposed, i.e., collaboration without information interaction, and collaboration with information interaction. In the first strategy, the UGV collects data from remote SNs (i.e., the SNs that cannot upload data to the UAV) as well as some normal SNs (i.e., the SNs that can upload data to the UAV), while the UAV only collects data from some normal SNs. Then, they carry the data back to the data center (DC) without interacting with each other. In the second strategy, the UGV only collects data from remote SNs, while transmitting the collected data to the UAV at a data interaction point, then the data are carried back to the DC by the UAV. There are mobile data collection nodes on the ground and in the air, and the task is to find trajectories to minimize the data collection time in the data center. A collaborative strategy selection algorithm, combining a multi-stage-based SN association and UAV-UGV path optimization algorithm, is proposed to solve the problem effectively, where techniques including convex optimization and genetic algorithm are adopted. The simulation result shows that the proposed scheme reduces the mission completion time by 36% compared with the benchmark scheme. © 2022 by the authors.","data collection; path planning; unmanned aerial vehicle–unmanned ground vehicle","Antennas; Convex optimization; Data acquisition; Genetic algorithms; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Completion time; Data collection; Data collection system; Datacenter; Energy; Information interaction; Remote sensors; Time minimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle–unmanned ground vehicle; Sensor nodes","W.

However, the reliability and timeliness of the existing path planning methods are usually intractable to guarantee due to the existence of communication delays between UAVs. To deal with this issue, in this paper, considering the communication delays, a distinctive “global planning-local obstacle avoidance” cooperative path planning framework based on the integration of the tube sparse A* algorithm and model predictive control (MPC) is constructed. In global planning phase, the priority decoupling mechanism and receding planning framework are used to incorporate collision avoidance coordination as constraints for the path planning model. Considering the probabilistic distribution of adjacent UAVs’ positions caused by random communication delays, a real-time global tube sparse A* path planning algorithm is customized, in which communication delays are assumed to obey Markov distribution. Subsequently, in local collision avoidance phase, considering the uncertainty of communication delays, some path segments generated by global path planning may still be at risk of collision with adjacent UAVs, the path of UAVs inside the tube will be tracked and adjusted by solving the optimization problem of the distributed MPC model. Lastly, simulation results demonstrate the reliability and timeliness of proposed algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Communication delays; Cooperative path planning; Model predictive control; Tube sparse A*; UAV swarm","Collision avoidance; Cooperative communication; Motion planning; Predictive control systems; Probability distributions; Tubes (components); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Communication delays; Cooperative path planning; Dynamics models; Global planning; Model-predictive control; Obstacles avoidance; Path planning method; Planning framework; Tube sparse A*; UAV swarm; Model predictive control","C.

However, the target movement is unpredictable in an uncertain environment, and multiple UAVs are affected by obstacles or inaccessible regions, resulting in the decreased surveillance performance and even the loss of the target. This article is dedicated to determine the current surveillance environment through the 2-D laser scanner. At the cost of the energy consumption and the transmission unreliability, a multi-UAV cooperative path optimization (MCPO) model is designed to adjust the surveillance location of each UAV, which improves the target surveillance performance. Specifically, for different types of obstacles or inaccessible regions, we present a novel obstacle-avoidance selection strategy with two mechanisms in mind: 1) when some of UAVs encounter obstacles, but others can accurately monitor the target, a strict constraint mechanism is established to promptly adjust the surveillance location of each UAV, which ensures the accuracy of formation surveillance and 2) when all UAVs have to avoid obstacles, a fuzzy constraint mechanism is presented and combined with Lucas-Kanade (LK) method to expand the search range of the multi-UAV and enhance the flexible adjustment capability of the formation. To verify the superiority of the proposed optimization method, we develop a 3-D simulation experiment environment based on the UE4 platform and design several groups of experiments to analyze the effectiveness of MCPO.

However, avoiding multiple time-varying obstacles and avoiding local optimum are two challenges for existing approaches in a dynamic environment. Firstly, a normalized artificial potential field optimization is proposed by reconstructing a novel function with anisotropy in each dimension, which can make the flight speed of a fixed UAV swarm independent of the repulsive/attractive gain coefficient and avoid trapping into local optimization and local oscillation. Then, taking into account minimum velocity and turning angular velocity of fixed-wing UAV swarm, a strategy of decomposing target vector to avoid moving obstacles and pop-up threats is proposed. Finally, several simulations are carried out to illustrate superiority and effectiveness. © 2021, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cooperative path planning; dynamic obstacle avoidance; fixed-wing UAV swarm; local optimization; normalized artificial potential field","Fixed wings; Motion planning; Artificial potential fields; Cooperative path planning; Dynamic collision avoidances; Dynamic obstacle avoidance; Field optimization; Fixed-wing UAV swarm; Local optima; Local optimizations; Normalized artificial potential field; Time varying; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","W.-H.

The proposed method includes two consecutive parts, the multi-UAV cooperative target search algorithm developed based on cooperative pigeon-inspired optimisation (CPIO) and the base returning algorithm for each UAV based on artificial potential field (APF) method. Firstly, a concerned regional environment and the initial search probability map models are established. Then, by applying the rolling prediction strategy, the cooperative target search paths for multiple UAVs are generated by utilising the proposed CPIO. With this method, UAVs can reinforce target search in the key areas in a cooperative way and avoid flying into the no-fly zones. In the meanwhile, the Bayesian theorem is used to constantly update the search probability map in each search step. Finally, at the end of the target search phase, an optimised safe path is generated for each UAV returning back to its original by using the APF method. Simulations are performed and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for multiple UAVs carrying out cooperative target search task in a complex environment.

The conventional test facilities could provide precise measurement. However, the process can be time consuming and costly. Airborne measurement could overcome the stated disadvantages and make the evaluation process faster and more accessible by offering the in-situ antenna evaluation. This UAV based antenna testing system has a Radio Frequency payload and can collect signal strength in the operation frequency of antennas under the test. As a part of the development of this test system, in this paper, a multi-agent path planning algorithm for area search is developed, which can adaptively guide the UAVs online. This developed algorithm can help the antenna evaluation process to be more reliable and faster in several stages of the evaluation. For example, before executing the antenna evaluation, the test-site needs to be evaluated in order to perform valid evaluations by ensuring there exists no interfering signals in the area. Also, another use case for this algorithm to be effective is radiation pattern measurement. Although flight path to cover the area can be planned offline and programmed before initiating flights, UAVs can experience unwanted change in their flight path during the measurement by environmental disturbances such as a gust. Hence, it is beneficial to have an online path planning algorithm to guide UAVs which can generate efficient cooperative flight path instantaneously. The presented path-planning algorithm uses deep reinforcement learning technique. The algorithm generates the actions for all UAVs in the continuous action space. Unlike the typical graph-based path-planning algorithm, we consider an image of an explored state map of the area as an input of the system. This map is generated based on the calculation of entropic information i from information theory and the task is terminated when this entropic information is above a defined threshold on all over the area. In this way, this algorithm can allow the system to generate more flexible flight path and ensure all the area is explored to meet with the required certainty when the exploration is finished. The result shows that the developed method can complete the mission with a great success rate with small number of communications.

Different from the state-of-the-art of recent research where all the UAVs involved are equipped with homogeneous payloads, this work exploits payload diversity to enhance the time efficiency of the cooperation and proposes a fast multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance (FMUCR) method. FMUCR groups UAVs in pairs. In each pair, one UAV is equipped with a passive positioning radar, referred to as p-UAV, while another is equipped with an active positioning radar, referred to as a-UAV. FMUCR exploits the large detection range and rough target location detection of passive radar to enable fast search and directional tracking of a target, while the precise target position calculation of active radar to enable accurate tracking of a target. Specifically, the task area is partitioned into subareas according to the number of UAV pairs. Each UAV pair conducts target search, localization, and tracking in one subarea, where the p-UAV leads searching and preliminary tracking of targets, while accurate tracking of targets are taken over by the a-UAV. Algorithms for off-line path planning and on-line path planning are designed, respectively, for target search and target tracking. The comparative simulation demonstrates that, FMUCR can greatly shorten the target discovery time with little loss in target tracking accuracy.  © 2022 IEEE.","different payloads; moving targets; Multi-UAV cooperation; reconnaissance","Aircraft detection; Clutter (information theory); Military applications; Motion planning; Tracking radar; Accurate tracking; Different payload; Localization and tracking; Moving targets; Multi UAV; Multi-UAV cooperation; Reconnaissance; Target localization; Target search; Targets tracking; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Y.

On the other hand, unlike fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have different operating processes and limited battery energy supply. Long flight times in the terminal area pose a risk of exhaustion and great safety challenges. Given the terminal area of the multi-vertiport system (MVS-TA), this paper investigates the adaptive control system (ACS), which includes the design of the operating environment and the integrated scheduling model. The design of the operating environment is the basis of adaptive management, which consists of the concept of multi-ring structure and the junction control rules based on backpressure policy. Considering the power constraint and dynamic priority, an integrated model including path planning model and distributed sequencing model is constructed to solve the cooperative scheduling problem of approach-departure flights. Results from numerical analyses reveal that: First, in the case of large flight flow, ACS can achieve the efficiency and safety of MVS-TA operation better than the traditional control system. Secondly, the flight density into the terminal area has a greater impact on ACS performance relative to flight volume. With a density of less than 120 flights/hour, the operating efficiency of MVS-TA under ACS varies within 10.3% with the number of flights or density. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive control system; eVTOL; Multi-vertiport system; Operational structure; Scheduling model; Urban air mobility","Air mobility; Aircraft control; Aircraft landing; Fixed wings; Flight control systems; Motion planning; Safety engineering; Scheduling; Structural design; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Area control; Control-rules; Electric vertical take-off and landing; Multi-vertiport system; Operating environment; Operational structure; Scheduling models; Terminal area; Urban air; Urban air mobility; air transportation; aircraft; control system; model; urban transport; Adaptive control systems","Q.

Due to limited energy availability and application requirements, drones may visit target points in consecutive trips, with recharging and data offloading in between. To capture timeliness of intervention and prioritize early coverage, we propose the new notion of Weighted Progressive Coverage, which is based on the definition of time dependent weights. Weighted progressive coverage generalizes classic notions of coverage, as well as a new notion of accumulative coverage specifically designed to address trip scheduling. We show that weighted progressive coverage maximization is NP-hard and propose an efficient polynomial algorithm, called Greedy and Prune (GaP), with guaranteed approximation. By means of simulations we show that GaP performs close to the optimal solution and outperforms a previous approach in all the considered performance metrics, including coverage, average inspection delay, energy consumption, and computation time, in a wide range of application scenarios. Through prototype experiments we also confirm the theoretical and simulation analysis, and demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm in real scenarios.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","drones; task assignment; Trajectory planning; UAV; vehicle routing","Antennas; Approximation algorithms; Drones; Energy utilization; Polynomial approximation; Application requirements; Energy applications; Energy availability; Limited energies; Multi trips; Target point; Tasks assignments; Time-dependent weights; Trajectory Planning; Trip scheduling; Vehicle routing","A.

However, due to the restricted optical measurement properties of monocular vision, there are drawbacks to monocular-vision-based obstacle perception; namely, the capability for obstacle range information perception and global obstacle perception is insufficient. In this paper, a local-bearing-angle-based trajectory planning algorithm is proposed for UAV collision avoidance. First, the observability of monocular-vision-based obstacle range perception is theoretically analyzed. The local coordinate system is selected for collision avoidance, and the bearing angle is selected as the observation. Second, the problem of UAV monocular vision collision avoidance trajectory planning is mathematically formulated. The quadratic Bezier curve is selected to model the trajectory, and the trajectory planning problem is transformed into optimization based on a single objective function. The collision avoidance constraint based on the relative bearing angle rate is designed, and the collision avoidance trajectory segment is optimized on the basis of the bearing angle observed within a limited time period. Finally, the receding horizon is adopted to optimize the trajectory sequence, and the sequences are connected to formulate the near-globally optimal trajectory. Simulation experiments reveal that the collision avoidance trajectory planning method is capable of avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles. Compared with global-information-based collision avoidance, the convergence time of the method proposed in this paper is reduced, and the near-globally optimal trajectory can be acquired in real time, which is in accordance with the perception capability of monocular vision. © 2021, Science Press.

In this paper, the formation cooperative flight of fixed-wing UAVs was modeled. First, the linear velocities in the three-dimensional direction of the traditional UAV model were changed to a linear velocity along the flight direction of the UAV, and the turning angular velocities and linear acceleration were set to establish the kinematics model. Then, based on the ""Lead plane-Wingman"" formation control structure, the order of friendly aircraft avoidance was defined by setting the priority of the formation members, and the target point of the wingman was dynamically calculated according to the target formation and real-time position of the leader plane. Finally, a UAV formation cooperative flight model was obtained. Considering the formation of five UAVs as an example, a simulation experiment was carried out, the results of which showed that the trajectory obtained based on the above model could meet the kinematics and collision avoidance requirements in formation flight of the fixedwing UAVs. © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach to solve the problem. In the first stage, we propose a region decomposition method based on a regular triangular grid, which converts the search region into a graph composed of nodes and edges. In the second stage, we use mixed linear integer programming (MILP) method to plan the coverage path based on the graph generated in the first stage. We use the actual parameters such as the drone's own camera, speed, energy, etc. to dissecte a rectangular area and accurately solve the MILP model, in the process of solving we designed three different scenarios to verify the feasibility and versatility of the model, and the solution results meet the expectations.

However, the operational complexity of such multi-agent systems requires defining effective architectures, coping with implementation details, and testing in realistic deployments. This article proposes X-IoCA, an Internet of robotic things (IoRT) and communication architecture consisting of a hybrid and heterogeneous network of wireless transceivers (H2WTN), based on LoRa and BLE technologies, and a robot operating system (ROS) network. The IoRT is connected to a feedback information system (FIS) distributed among multi-access edge computing (MEC) centers. Furthermore, we present SAR-IoCA, an implementation of the architecture for search and rescue (SAR) integrated into a 5G network. The FIS for this application consists of an SAR-FIS (including a path planner for UGVs considering risks detected by a LoRa H-WSN) and an ROS-FIS (for real-time monitoring and processing of information published throughout the ROS network).

This paper investigates a joint safety information interaction scheme for a UAV-enabled network, which involves the complex constraints of three-dimensional trajectory planning, average energy efficiency optimization, and physical-layer security. Specifically, by modeling the UAV and the Ground Station (GS) as the transmit sources, we define the secure Energy Efficiency (EE) as the ratio of the total secrecy rate to the energy consumption of the whole system. Then, to achieve secure and energy-efficient communication in eavesdropping scenarios, we formulated the optimization problem as maximizing both the uplink/downlink secure EE of the system, subject to the constraints of the UAV’s mobility and the allowable transmit power. For this highly coupled non-convex problem, a composite solution of joint fractional programming, alternate optimization, the bisection method, and the interior-point method is proposed to obtain the achievable EE. Simulation and performance analysis gave the conclusions that the joint optimization of trajectory and power allocation is capable of maximizing the information secure EE. Additionally, the secure EE increases with the increase of the average transmit power, which finally tends to be stable. © 2022 by the authors.

The numerous studies on UAVs cooperative air-to-ground mission controlling have been reported, but few have considered the impact of the communication instability due to electromagnetic interference (EMI) which is common in many air-to-ground applications. Under the influence of EMI, the air-to-ground mission stages are represented as a dynamic combination of several communication-available and communication-unavailable stages. Traditional cooperative surveillance algorithms cannot handle such situations well. In this study, we presented a method which based on Voronoi diagrams to solve the impact of communication outages, and an attention mechanism ant-colony optimization (AACO) algorithm was proposed for UAV path-planning control in air-to-ground surveillance missions. The controlling strategy is adaptively updated by introducing an attention mechanism for regular instruction information, a priori information, and emergent information of the mission to satisfy the mission target. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better search performance than traditional algorithms in scenarios which include communication-available and communication-unavailable situations.  © 2022 ICROS.","Air-to-Ground Surveillance; Attention mechanism ant-colony optimization (AACO); Cooperative control; Dynamic path-planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); Voronoi diagram","Antennas; Computational geometry; Cooperative communication; Dynamics; Electromagnetic pulse; Graphic methods; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Air-to-ground surveillance; Attention mechanism ant-colony optimization; Attention mechanisms; Co-operative control; Dynamic path planning; Ground surveillance; Planning and controlling; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Voronoi diagrams; Ant colony optimization","Z.

However, due to the limited storage capacities of UAVs and uncertain navigation paths of USVs, it is challenging to accomplish the ocean observation mission. In this paper, a UAV and USV cooperative content offloading scheme in AOINs with Q-learning and game theory is proposed. Specifically, the state evaluation mechanism for both UAV and USV is first designed to make cooperation strategies. Afterward, the interaction between UAV and USV is modeled as the bargaining game, where the Nash equilibrium as the optimal transaction price is obtained by the backward induction method. To realize the maximization of revenue, we devise a Q-learning based algorithm to make path planning for each USV to offload contents as many as possible under the limited energy.

DPD-SCP splits a coupled swarm trajectory planning problem into several single-UAV convex programming subproblems, and the computational efficiency and scalability are enhanced by utilizing distributed computation. The flight-time-driven dynamic priority decoupled mechanism is designed to improve the convergence rate of swarm trajectory iterations. In this decoupled mechanism, the priority of UAVs with short flight time is lowered to explore the UAV's trajectory adjustment potential and eliminate the oscillation problem due to mutual avoidance of swarms. The time-consistency constraint update criterion is customized to avoid abnormal growth of swarm flight time. Furthermore, it is theoretically validated that DPD-SCP can generate the swarm trajectories that can satisfy the constraints of dynamics, collision avoidance, and time consistency. The simulation results show that the efficiency of DPD-SCP is significantly higher than that of the coupled SCP, serial-priority-decoupled SCP, and parallel-decoupled SCP methods. © 2022, Beihang University Aerospace Knowledge Press.

Exploration processes like cave exploration, tunnel inspections required an accurate and quick mapping of the environment in emergencies for rescue or maintenance operations. This multi-robot system's main objective is to use the Dijkstra algorithm to produce a 2D and 3D map of an unexplored region. Each robot features a border identification system that uses image processing to derive border locations. The autonomous exploration problem is a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to the local planner exploration component. The robot is directed to the uncharted region in the map after recovering boundary points in the region separating known from unknown space. The global planner graph, introducing flexible values, is constructed during the discovery phase to examine the robot's border positions at the end. The two methodologies are combined with speeding up the search for border sites. Closed-loop control ensures that the robot is always pushed to its greatest advantage following achieving the desired advantages.

While extensive studies have been conducted on the advantages of UAVs for various construction-related processes, studies on UAV collaboration to improve the task capacity and efficiency are still scarce. This paper proposes a new cooperative path planning algorithm for multiple UAVs based on the stag hunt game and particle swarm optimization (PSO). First, a cost function for each UAV is defined, incorporating multiple objectives and constraints. The UAV game framework is then developed to formulate the multi-UAV path planning into the problem of finding payoff-dominant e quilibrium. Next, a PSO-based algorithm is proposed to obtain optimal paths for the UAVs.

In view of the UAV function’s failure and fail to complete the assigned task, a dynamic task adjustment algorithm is proposed to distinguish the mission stages. Based on the task allocation scheme, the hierarchical adjustment strategy is developed, which take the adjustment time, communication cost and adjustment load into consideration respectively, so as to reduce the adjustment cost and improve the combat capability of the UAV formation on the basis of ensuring the completion of the combat task.

A joint trajectory planning and mission assignment problem is formulated as a constrained multi-objective system utility function maximization problem. To solve the formulated problem, a two-stage heuristic algorithm is proposed. Specifically, a hybrid Tabu simulated annealing-based trajectory optimization is proposed in the first stage. Then, based on the trajectory strategy of UAVs, we present a two-sided matching-based mission assignment algorithm. Simulation results show that compared to baseline algorithms, the proposed algorithm offers better performance. © 2022 IEEE.","mission planning; trajectory optimization; UAV; utility function","Aerodynamics; Antennas; Combinatorial optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Simulated annealing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Low-costs; Low-high; Mission planning; Multi objective; Performance; Trajectory optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Utility functions; Utility optimizations; Trajectories","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166545085-0","","","English","IEEE Int.

LPD-SCP divides swarm trajectory planning problems into a series of short-horizon single-UAV convex optimization subproblems, which can improve the computational efficiency and security of trajectories. This paper derives the length of feasible planning horizon to ensure the safety of trajectories. The communication-distance-limited local-priority decoupling mechanism is designed to adjust the priority of UAVs in the neighborhood according to the communication condition for achieving collision avoidance under communication distance limitation. In addition, the trajectory-time-consistency adjustment strategy is customized to realize the flight time consistency of UAVs in the neighborhood by updating the lower boundary constraint of flight time. It is theoretically guaranteed that the proposed LPD-SCP can obtain a swarm trajectory in several receding planning horizons subject to flight constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that LPD-SCP can plan the cooperative trajectories satisfying the flight performance, collision avoidance, and time consistency constraints under communication distance limitation, and the runtime of generating the short-horizon rendezvous trajectories for 15 UAVs is less than 4 s. © 2022 Scientia Sinica Informationis.

The Artificial Potential Field (APF) method, which is widely used in robot path planning domain, have advantages of low computational cost and fast calculation ability. However basic APF method may lead the UAV to the 'repulsive dilemma'. Considering each UAV as their obstacles, we use APF method for UAV's collision avoidance and provide a priority allocation rules and exempt mechanism based on geometry for high-efficiency cooperative conflict resolution, especially in uncertain communication circumstance. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we set three cases of experiment and introduce the 'clone airspace' inspired by the concept of cell in chemistry sphere for improving the simulation performance.

It is challenging to comprehensively plan the inter-area visiting order and the intra-area coverage paths simultaneously. Due to the battery limitation, usually the task can hardly be finished by a single UAV, and instead a fleet of UAVs are required. In this article, we first formulate an energy-aware multi-UAV multi-area coverage path planning (EM2CPP) model, in order to characterize the practical path planning requirements of UAVs in complex conditions. Subsequently, to accomplish the optimization task, we propose a bipartite cooperative coevolution (BiCC) algorithm that coevolves an inter-area path planning and an intra-area path planning components to obtain good solutions. The basic operators in BiCC, such as the initialization and the reproduction operators, are tailored for the task of EM2CPP. Besides, we also develop a fast heuristic algorithm for EM2CPP, which is able to produce approximate solutions in a short time. Simulations on real-world datasets validate the good performance of the proposed methods.  © 2020 IEEE.","Cooperative coevolution; coverage path planning (CPP); energy consumption; heuristic; UAVs","Antennas; Cell proliferation; Heuristic algorithms; Motion planning; Optimization; Power management; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Area coverages; Complex optimization problems; Cooperative co-evolution; Coverage path planning; Energy aware; Energy-consumption; Heuristic; Multi areas; Multiple targets; Energy utilization","Y.-J.

However, as a classical NP hard problem, the problem scale and computational complexity of the multiple traveling salesman problem have very high requirements for the solution method. This paper focuses on the multiple traveling salesman problem. Firstly, several characteristics, objective functions, problem constraints and variants of MTSP model are subdivided. Secondly, it classifies and sorts out the specific methods of several common heuristic algorithms in solving MTSP, and compares the similarities and differences of optimization objectives and solutions under different algorithms, so as to understand the general methods of solving multiple traveling salesman problems among different algorithms more intuitively. With the continuous development of multiple traveling salesman problem, scholars are not satisfied with simply solving mathematical problems, and try to regard many practical problems that meet conditions as multiple traveling salesman problems. This paper summarizes the specific construction methods of MTSP model in the context of practical applications such as logistics distribution, wireless sensor network, emergency rescue and UAV collaborative task planning. From the perspective of application results, using MTSP model to solve practical problems can not only reduce enterprise and individual costs, improve revenue, but also promote the development of this field towards a more efficient and intelligent direction.

A higher partition of the flight environment leads to an increase in route’s accuracy but at the expense of greater planning complexity. In this paper, a new Parallel Cooperative Coevolutionary Grey Wolf Optimizer (PCCGWO) is proposed to solve such a planning problem. The proposed PCCGWO metaheuristic applies cooperative coevolutionary concepts to ensure an efficient partition of the original search space into multiple sub-spaces with reduced dimensions. The decomposition of the decision variables vector into several sub-components is achieved and multi-swarms are created from the initial population. Each sub-swarm is then assigned to optimize a part of the LSGO problem. To form the complete solution, the representatives from each sub-swarm are combined. To reduce the computation time, an efficient parallel master-slave model is introduced in the proposed parameters-free PCCGWO. The master will be responsible for decomposing the original problem and constructing the context vector which contains the complete solution. Each slave is designed to evolve a sub-component and will send the best individual as its representative to the master after each evolutionary cycle. Demonstrative results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PCCGWO-based planning technique in terms of several metrics of performance and nonparametric statistical analyses. These results show that the increase in the number of slaves leads to a more efficient result as well as a further improved computational time. © 2022 by the authors.

In AI-enabled UAV applications, UAVs generate amounts of computation-intensive tasks (e.g., image recognition, video processing, and path planning, etc.) that cannot be locally executed by UAVs in time. How to offload the computation-intensive tasks of UAVs timely and effectively has become an urgent challenge. Multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) integrated into a USV fleet is appealingly advocated to provide abundant computation resources for computation tasks. In this paper, we propose a collaborative computation offloading scheme with UAVs and USV fleets in maritime communication networks. Specifically, we first propose a collaborative computation offloading framework, where UAVs act as the requesters of computation offloading, and USV fleets are the assistants. Then, to minimize the overall execution time of computation tasks, UAVs determine the optimal ratio of compu-tation tasks offloaded to USV fleets in the worst case. Afterwards, the first sealed reverse auction with reserve price is utilized to incentivize USV fleets to assist in executing computation tasks of UAVs, where the reserve price guarantees the satisfied benefits of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the overall execution time and improves the expected revenue of the USV fleet as compared to conventional schemes. © 2022 IEEE.","auction game; collaborative compu-tation offloading; Communication networks; UAV; USV fleet","Antennas; computation offloading; Fleet operations; Image recognition; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Video signal processing; Aerial vehicle; Auction games; Collaborative compu-tation offloading; Collaborative computation; Communications networks; Computation offloading; Computation tasks; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned surface vehicle fleet; Vehicle fleets; Unmanned surface vehicles","Z.

Although previous studies have achieved remarkable success in this field, they focused on the tasks of single UAV automatic inspection and UAV path planning, without considering multi-UAV collaborative inspection tasks. To solve these problems, we propose a novel improved genetic algorithm with multi-level chromosome hybrid coding and dual population selection, which is called CHDS-GA. Specifically, based on the multi-traveling salesman problem (M-TSP), we established the multi-UAV traveling salesman problem model with charging stations (MU-TSP-C) and encouraged UAVs to select tasks adaptively according to the present power. In small-scale experiments, the CHDS-GA can obtain approximate optimal solutions with little running time; in large-scale experiments, the relationship between the solution time and tasks are approximately linear as the tasks increase. The results demonstrate that the CHDS-GA has superior performance. © 2021 IEEE.","genetic algorithm; intensive corridors of transmission lines; multi-UAV inspection; TSP","Antennas; Chromosomes; Electric lines; Genetic algorithms; Inspection; Motion planning; Traveling salesman problem; Vehicle transmissions; Allocation methods; Cooperative tasks; Inspection tasks; Intensive corridor of transmission line; Line inspections; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle inspection; Task allocation; Transmission-line; TSP; Vehicle inspections; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","M.

To avoid the UAVs being visually noticed by the ground transmitters, we propose a new measure to quantify the disguising performance of the UAVs. The trajectories of the UAVs are planned to maximize the disguising performance, subject to an uninterrupted eavesdropping requirement, UAV collision avoidance and UAV aeronautic maneuverability.

Firstly, the UAV formation maintenance controller is designed by 'virtual leader-follower' formation. Then, a UAV formation cooperative obstacle avoidance controller is designed by combining the communication topology of UAV formation with the artificial potential field method improved by introducing the attraction field of the goal point and the auxiliary potential field. In addition, a strategy of transforming linear formation is proposed to adapt to the narrow environment. Finally, the experimental simulation shows that the UAV formation can not only maintain the formation while avoiding obstacles, but also transform the linear formation through the narrow area. © 2022 IEEE.","formation flight; formation transformation; improved artificial potential field method; obstacle avoidance; unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Collision avoidance; Controllers; Cooperative communication; Motion planning; Aerial vehicle; Artificial potential fields method; Cooperative path planning; Formation flight; Formation maintenances; Formation transformation; Improved artificial potential field method; Linear formations; Obstacles avoidance; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","W.

This poses a problem when an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is tracking multiple ground targets on a road network larger than its field-of-view. To address this problem, we propose a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to maintain individual target tracks and to perform probabilistic data association when the targets are constrained to a road network. This is particularly useful when a target leaves and then re-enters the UAV’s field-of-view. The RBPF is structured as a particle filter of particle filters. The top level filter handles data association and each of its particles maintains a bank of particle filters to handle target tracking. The tracking particle filters incorporate both positive and negative information when a measurement is received. We implement two path planning controllers, receding horizon and deep reinforcement learning, and compare their ability to improve the certainty for multiple target location estimates. The controllers prioritize paths that reduce each target’s entropy. In addition, we develop an algorithm that computes the upper bound on the filter’s performance, thus facilitating an estimate of the number of UAVs needed to achieve a desired performance threshold.

In order to decrease the search duration and improve the search efficiency of moving targets, the dynamic and time-sensitive key area model is formulated according to the target probability map by just searching the key areas instead of searching whole mission area. On this basis, these key areas are allocated to different UAVs and the moving targets searching problem is modeled as the dynamic coupled traveling salesman problem (DC-TSP). The coupled solution framework consisting of the task allocation layer and the path planning layer is designed to solve this problem, where the former confirms the number of tasks and execution order for each UAV to sequential search the key areas using an opposition-based genetic algorithm with the elite strategy, and the latter solves the search path for the UAV to execute its search tasks using depth first search with the receding horizon optimization.

Within these scenarios the global objective might often be better achieved if aspects of the problem can be optimally shared amongst its agents. However, in uncertain, dynamic and often partially observable environments centralised global-optimisation techniques are not achievable. Instead, agents may have to act on their own belief of the world, making the best decisions independently and potentially myopically. With multiple agents acting in a decentralised manner how can we discourage competitive behaviour and instead facilitate cooperation. This paper focuses on the specific problem of multiple UAVs simultaneously searching for tasks in an environment whilst efficiently routing between them and ultimately visiting them. This paper is motivated by this idea that collaboration can be simple and achieved without the need for a dialogue but instead through the design of the individual agent’s behaviour. By focusing on what is communicated we expand the use of a single agent behaviour. Which through minor modifications can produce distinct agents demonstrating independent, collaborative and competitive behaviour. In particular by investigating the role of sensor and communication ranges this paper will show that increased sensor ranges can be detrimental to system performance, and instead the simple modelling of nearby agents’ intent is a far better approach. © 2022 by the authors.

To validate paths, we leverage the HoloLens spatial map to check for potential collisions ahead of time, greatly reducing the likelihood of a collision during drone navigation. Paths are simplified and cleaned up using density-based clustering to prevent complex or redundant drone movement.

The coupling between path planning and task allocation, the heterogeneity of UAVs, and the dynamic nature of task environment greatly increase the complexity and difficulty of the UAV swarm cooperative search-attack mission planning problem. Inspired by the collaborative hunting behavior of wolf pack, a distributed self-organizing method for UAV swarm search-attack mission planning is proposed. First, to solve the multi-target search problem in unknown environments, a wolf scouting behavior-inspired cooperative search algorithm for UAV swarm is designed. Second, a distributed self-organizing task allocation algorithm for UAV swarm cooperative attacking of targets is proposed by analyzing the flexible labor division behavior of wolves. By abstracting the UAV as a simple artificial wolf agent, the flexible motion planning and group task coordinating for UAV swarm can be realized by self-organizing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a set of simulation experiments, the stability and scalability are evaluated, and the integrated solution for the coupled path planning and task allocation problems for the UAV swarm cooperative search-attack task can be well performed. © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.","hunting behavior; labor division; search-attack mission planning; swarm intelligence; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm; wolf pack","Antennas; Behavioral research; Military vehicles; Motion planning; Swarm intelligence; Cooperative search; Hunting behavior; Labor division; Mission planning; Search-attack mission planning; Self-organised; Self-organising; Task allocation; Unmanned aerial vehicle  swarm; Wolf pack; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","W.

The proposed algorithm divides UAV swarm path planning into two stages. In the first stage, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to process the static environment information rapidly. Then, several non-dominated feasible paths based on reference point method can be selected. These non-dominated feasible paths are used as the preset flight direction of UAV swarm. In the second stage, the dynamic of the quadrotor UAV is taken into consideration for the UAV swarm path planning. In order to achieve collision avoidance and obstacle avoidance in the paths, develop the collision-free flocking behavior for a dynamic squad of quadrotor UAVs.

When they cooperate on continuous patrol, using UGVs as mobile charging station for the drones can solve the problem of insufficient drone battery life. The UGVs which are restricted in the road network replenish energy for drones at appropriate locations, this makes the paths of the two vehicles highly coupled and brings challenges to air-ground cooperative path planning. To solve this problem, this paper analyzes the constraints of UAV energy, road network, air-ground convergence time, full coverage of patrol missions, and establishes an air-ground cooperative patrol path planning model with the total distance of the UAV completing all patrol missions as a cost function. This model can be extended to situations where multiple drones cooperate with multiple UGVs. Then, the combination of genetic algorithm and ant colony algorithm is used to optimize the patrol path of drones and the energy supply path of UGVs simultaneously. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method not only can obtain good path planning results, but also has better convergence and execution speed than other algorithms. © 2022, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

Due to UAVs’ constraints such as limited power lifetime, it has been necessary to assist them with ground sensors to gather local data, which has to be transferred to UAVs upon visiting the sensors. The management of such ground sensor communication together with a team of flying UAVs constitutes an interesting data muling problem, which still deserves to be addressed and investigated. This paper revisits the issue of traffic engineering in Internet-of-Things (IoT) settings, to assess the relevance of using UAVs for the persistent collection of sensor readings from the sensor nodes located in an environment and their delivery to base stations where further processing is performed. We propose a persistent path planning and UAV allocation model, where a team of heterogeneous UAVs coming from various base stations are used to collect data from ground sensors and deliver the collected information to their closest base stations. This problem is mathematically formalised as a real-time constrained optimisation model, and proven to be NP-hard.

In particular, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been developed and utilized for various purposes. In this study, we developed a method for the path generation of UGVs in a system in which one operator controls many different types of unmanned vehicles. In the driving control system (DCS), it is necessary to process sensor data such as GPS/INS and LiDAR when generating a path by receiving the target waypoint from the ground control station. In addition, the DCS must upload the current location, posture, state, etc., as well as save driving log. Therefore, in order to recognize obstacles in real time and generate a path, a safe path generation algorithm with a short computation time is required. Among the various path generation methods, the potential field algorithm was selected, and the algorithm was modified to reduce the computation time. The computation time before and after modification of the algorithm was obtained and compared through simulation, and the algorithm was verified through application to an actual system by performing an obstacle avoidance experiment and a simultaneous control experiment for two UGVs. © 2022 by the authors.

To provide a preferable initial condition for the Initial Path part, Dubins path method is firstly utilized for achieving heading angle consistency. Subsequently, a time based online cooperative range adjustment method is developed to ensure that the path range of each UAV to reach synchronization. Consequently, the fixed-wing UAVs are able to reach the terminal point simultaneously, thus completing the assembly mission successfully.

The cooperation between multiple robots will not only promote the efficient completion of tasks and enhance the reliability of the system but advances cooperation to complete additional complex tasks.

These applications include collaborative crop monitoring, aerial transportation, offshore delivery, facility monitoring, disaster relieve as well as search and rescue. Current UAV operations are heavily dependent on human operators that require each UAV to be controlled by a dedicated safety pilot as well as a separate payload operator which limits the efficient use of UAVs required in swarm applications. There is thus an imperative to mature mapping and path planning technologies to allow UAV swarm operations. This paper explores mapping and path planning strategies that allow higher levels of autonomy for a UAV swarm to operate reliably. In this work we developed novel strategies to facilitate swarm mapping, and swarm path planning. The methods developed can be easily scaled to adapt to different UAV swarm sizes. The developed strategies are implemented and tested using simulations.

Although there are many unique features of UAV networks, their widespread use is still hampered by the short battery life. As a result, most of the research efforts in this domain mainly have focused on the efficient use of energy through trajectory planning and cooperative communication. While there have been a few proposals to use energy harvesting techniques for UAV networks, a complete understanding of the performance limits of such networks is still missing in the literature and needs further investigations. Within this context, our paper provides a comprehensive performance evaluation of UAV relay networks (UAVRNs) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, a cooperative communication system, where a UAV serves as a mobile relay, is fully considered. The UAV relay is considered to be wirelessly-powered and harvests energy from the radio signals received from a nearby base station. For the sake of comparison, both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols are considered. Subsequently, the closed-form expressions of outage probabilities and ergodic capacities are provided for each UAV relaying protocol. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions. The results provided in this work characterize the outage and ergodic capacity performance of NOMA-enabled UAVRNs. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

UAVs can detect corrosion patches and other defects on the surface from low-resolution images. If defects are detected, they get closer to the surface for a high-resolution inspection. The prior information provides expected defects locations and is affected by both false positives and false negatives. The mission objective is to prioritize the close-up inspection of defected areas while keeping a reasonable time for the coverage of the entire surface. We propose two solutions to this problem: a coverage algorithm that divides the problem into a set of Traveling Salesman Problems (Part-TSP) and a cooperative frontier approach that introduces frontier utilities to incorporate the prior information (Coop-Frontier). We finally provide extensive simulation results to analyze the performance of these approaches and compare them with alternative solutions. These results suggest that both Part-Tspand Coop-Frontier perform better than the baseline solution. Part-Tsphas the best performance in most cases. However, coop-Frontier is preferable in extreme cases because more robust to inhomogeneous corrosion distribution and imperfect information. © 2022 IEEE.","","Antennas; Autonomous underwater vehicles; Corrosion; Fleet operations; Hulls (ship); Motion planning; Traveling salesman problem; Water tanks; Aerial vehicle; High resolution inspection; Large surfaces; Low resolution images; On-line path planning; Path planning problems; Performance; Prior information; Ship hull; Surface from; Inspection","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21530858","978-166547927-1","85RBA","","English","IEEE Int Conf Intell Rob Syst","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146338689"

It can facilitate the solution of the flight trajectory problem that occurs after the reallocation of mission points. Trajectory coordinates are expanded based on the Bezier curves that naturally satisfy boundary conditions (BCs); trajectories with the minimum flight time and those satisfying the dynamic constraints and collision-free conditions can be obtained by adjusting the Bezier coefficients. A three-UAV flight simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further, the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM). The simulation results of the BCBS method are used as the initial values for GPM optimization. It is demonstrated that the BCBS method requires a lower computation time than the direct solver, which is only 0.07 of the latter, and obtains similar optimization results (3.34 difference). This is considerably important for the rapid generation of optimized trajectories with the limited computing power of onboard computers. Furthermore, this method is expected to achieve online collaborative trajectory generation for multiple UAVs in view of its high computational efficiency.

Previous works in engineering problem solving have studied the effectiveness of teams and individuals, showing that in some circumstances, individuals can outperform collaborative teams working on the same task. The current work extends these insights to novel team configurations in large interdisciplinary teams. In these team configurations, the meta-team as a whole can interact but the sub-teams within them may or may not. Here, team performance and process are studied within the context of a complex drone design and path-planning problem. Via a collaborative research platform called HyForm, communication and behavioral patterns can be tracked and analyzed throughout problem solving. This works shows that nominal sub-structured teams, where members work independently, outperform interacting sub-structured teams. While problem-solving actions remain consistent, communication patterns significantly differ, with nominal sub-structured teams communicating significantly less. Questionnaires reveal that the manager roles in the nominal sub-structured teams, which are more central in communication and information flow, experience a greater cognitive and workload burden than their counterparts in the interacting sub-structured teams. Overall, this work adds to the literature on nominal versus interacting problem-solving teams, extending the finding to larger, interdisciplinary teams.

In urban area, heterogeneous access points such as Wi-Fi routers and base stations can meet the required communication coverage and bandwidth in data collection processes. However, in remote area, without communication infrastructures, it is hard to guarantee the communication quality of a large-scale data aggregation network. An existing approach is to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to act as a mobile sink to perform data collection and increase the coverage of intelligent wireless sensing and communications. The efficiency and the reliability of such a UAV-assisted data collection system can be significantly enhanced with an intelligent cooperative strategy for the sensors deployed in the field to communicate with the UAV. Furthermore, an energy-efficient trajectory planning algorithm is crucial to address the physical limitations of the UAV in this application. In this paper, a data collection process is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The paper begins with proposing two heuristic greedy algorithms, namely distance-greedy (DG) algorithm and rate-greedy (RG) algorithm, which are designed based on prior knowledge of the system and can guarantee the completion of the data collection process in a remote area without the help of fixed communication infrastructures. Based on the outcomes, a multi-agent greedy-model-based reinforcement learning (MG-RL) algorithm is proposed, which specifically designs the environmental state and the reward scheme, and introduces multiple UAVs with different parameters to explore environments in parallel to accelerate the training. In conclusion, the two proposed greedy algorithms have lower complexity of implementation while the proposed MG-RL algorithm yields practical UAVs’ flight trajectories and shortens the time for completing a data collection task. © 2021","Beyond-5G; Cooperative; Data collection; Intelligent communication; Mobile sink; Reinforcement learning; UAVs","5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Computational complexity; Cooperative communication; Data acquisition; Energy efficiency; Heuristic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Multi agent systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Urban planning; Beyond-5g; Cooperative; Data collection; Data collection process; Greedy algorithms; Intelligent communication; Mobile sinks; Model-based reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Remote areas; Reinforcement learning","Q.

Although heterogeneous UAVs have an enormous advantage in improving performance and conserving energy with respect to homogeneous ones, they give rise to a complex path planning problem. Especially in large-scale cooperative search systems with multiple separated regions, coverage path planning which seeks optimal paths for UAVs to completely visit and search all of regions of interest, has a NP-hard computation complexity and is difficult to settle. In this work, we focus on the coverage path planning problem of heterogeneous UAVs, and present an ant colony system (ACS)-based algorithm to obtain good enough paths for UAVs and fully cover all regions efficiently. First, models of UAVs and regions are built, and a linear programming-based formulation is presented to exactly provide the best point-to-point flight path for each UAV. Then, inspired by the foraging behaviour of ants that they can obtain the shortest path between their nest and food, an ACS-based heuristic is presented to seek approximately optimal solutions and minimize the time consumption of tasks in the cooperative search system. Experiments on randomly generated regions have been organized to evaluate the performance of the new heuristic in terms of execution time, task completion time and deviation ratio. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ant colony system; Coverage path planning; Heterogeneous UAVs; Multiple regions; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Linear programming; Motion planning; Safety devices; Ant's colony system; Cooperative search; Coverage path planning; Energy; Heterogeneous UAV; Improving performance; Multiple regions; Path planning problems; Practical systems; Search system; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","J.

However, the limited battery capacity restricts UAVs from performing such persistent missions. In this paper, we consider a general hybrid trajectory planning problem to efficiently provide emergency communications in time-constrained disaster-affected regions, where a ground vehicle carrying backup batteries moves along with the UAV as a 'mobile charging platform' to handle the energy issue of the UAV. Our optimization task is to minimize the total cost of the mission. We show that the optimization task is an extension of the traveling salesman problem with soft time window constraints. Due to the NP-hardness of the task, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning with a sequential model strategy to learn the policy for the UAV's visiting order, based on which the collaborative routes of the UAV and ground vehicle are designed.

This paper proposes a distributed cooperative heuristic (DCH) algorithm for the mission of multi-UAVs search multi-targets, aiming at the problem of cooperative search path planning for multi-UAVs in an environment with obstacles. The proposed method DCH is based on receding horizon optimization (RHO) strategy and cooperation-competition scheme. According to the change of environment, the prediction time-domain of RHO is changed, and RHO with variable step-ahead prediction is introduced. Moreover, the pigeons-inspired cooperation-competition (PICC) scheme for multi-UAVs is designed, including cooperation module and competition module. Through information interaction, multi-UAVs can expand their search horizons, and cooperate with each other to improve search efficiency. In addition, the environmental cognitive information map (ECIM) and value income function (VIF) is also reasonably improved. Several contrastive simulations demonstrate that compared with other existing approaches, the proposed algorithm uses less time and shows a better performance of target search.  © 2022 IEEE.","cooperative target search mission; multi-agents cooperative algorithm; pigeons-inspired cooperation-competition scheme; receding horizon optimization; UAV cooperation","Antennas; Motion planning; Multi agent systems; Optimization; Software agents; Time domain analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Cooperation/competition; Cooperative algorithm; Cooperative target search mission; Cooperative targets; Multi agent; Multi-agent cooperative algorithm; Pigeon-inspired cooperation-competition scheme; Receding horizon optimization; Search missions; Target search; Unmanned aerial vehicle cooperation; Heuristic algorithms","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166546533-5","","","English","Proc. - Chin.

Based on the related basic concepts, typical three-dimensional obstacle models, such as spherical and cubic, and their collision checking criteria are presented in this article. An improved rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm with goal bias and greed property is proposed based on the heuristic search strategy to overcome the shortcomings of the classical RRT algorithm. Not only are the kinematic constraints of the quadrotor established but the time and space coordination strategy matching with the improved RRT algorithm is also presented in this article. Furthermore, a novel online collision avoidance strategy according to the partial information of the surrounding environment is proposed. On the basis of the above work, a distributed online path planning strategy is proposed to obtain the feasible path for each quadrotor. Numerical simulation results show that the improved RRT algorithm has better search efficiency than the classical RRT algorithm. And the satisfactory path planning and path tracking results prove that the above model and related planning strategies are reasonable and effective. © IMechE 2021.","Cooperative path planning; distributed online planning; improved rapidly exploring random tree algorithm; online collision avoidance; unknown dynamic environment","Heuristic algorithms; Trees (mathematics); Cooperative path planning; Coordination strategy; Dynamic environments; Heuristic search strategy; Kinematic constraints; On-line path planning; Rapidly-exploring random trees; Surrounding environment; Drones","Z.

This study aims to outline how an energy-autonomous swarm of Unmanned Aerial System can help to increase the monitored sea area while minimizing human resource demand. Design/methodology/approach: A concept for an unattended swarm of solar powered, unmanned hydroplanes is proposed. A swarm operations concept, vehicle conceptual design and an initial vehicle sizing method is derived. A microscopic, multi-agent-based simulation model is developed. System characteristics and surveillance performance is investigated in this delimited environment number of vehicles scale. Parameter variations in insolation, overcast and system design are used to predict system characteristics. The results are finally used for a scale-up study on a macroscopic level. Findings: Miniaturization of subsystems is found to be essential for energy balance, whereas power consumption of subsystems is identified to define minimum vehicle size. Seasonal variations of solar insolation are observed to dominate the available energy budget. Thus, swarm density and activity adaption to solar energy supply is found to be a key element to maintain continuous aerial surveillance. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted extra-occupationally. Resources were limited to the available range of literature, computational power number and time budget. Practical implications: A proposal for a probable concept of operations, as well as vehicle preliminary design for an unmanned energy-autonomous, multi-vehicle system for maritime surveillance tasks, are presented and discussed. Indications on path planning, communication link and vehicle interaction scheme selection are given. Vehicle design drivers are identified and optimization of parameters with significant impact on the swarm system is shown. Social implications: The proposed system can help to accelerate the detection of ships in distress, increasing the effectiveness of life-saving rescue missions. Originality/value: For continuous surveillance of expanded mission theatres by small-sized vehicles of limited endurance, a novel, collaborative swarming approach applying in situ resource utilization is explored. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaborative swarming; Maritime surveillance; Sea rescue; Solar-powered UAV; Swarming; UAV design; UAV swarming","Antennas; Budget control; Conceptual design; Monitoring; Motion planning; Multi agent systems; Solar energy; Collaborative swarming; Energy; Maritime-surveillance; Mediterranean sea; Sea rescue; Solar-powered; Solar-powered UAV; Swarming; UAV designs; UAV swarming; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","F.-M.

Nevertheless, in the context of multi-access edge computing (MEC), a key pillar for meeting 5G key performance indicators, state-of-the-art design suffers from difficulty in matching time/spatial-varying communication/computation demands with distributed resources in highly dynamic air-ground integrated networks. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a joint online trajectory planning and offloading scheduling scheme based on reinforcement learning (RL), such that a UAV and base stations in a multi-cell network can dynamically and collaboratively offer edge computing services. We formulate the decision-making on trajectory planning/offloading scheduling as mutually embedded Markov decision processes, so as to avoid exponentially increasing joint state/action spaces and non-cooperative decision-making. In order to learn the policies for decision-making, novel RL algorithms are proposed based on deep Q-network and the kernel method, respectively. It is shown that the learned policy is able to make the joint trajectory planning and offloading scheduling adaptive to dynamic computation demands. Benefiting from this, the air-ground collaborative MEC can significantly outperform the terrestrial-only MEC in terms of the average backlog of newly produced computational task bits. © 2022 IEEE.","computation offloading; multi-access edge computing; reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicle","5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Benchmarking; computation offloading; Decision making; Markov processes; Scheduling; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Air grounds; Computation offloading; Decisions makings; Edge computing; Multi-access edge computing; Multiaccess; Reinforcement learnings; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Reinforcement learning","Y.

However, when performing tasks in a complex environment, how to quickly plan the collaborative flight path of multi-UAV is always a challenging research topic. Aiming at the problem that the traditional genetic algorithm has a single way of connecting path points in the process of path planning, it is difficult to adapt to the complex environment and the long path length, this paper proposes an improved genetic algorithm. Wherein, the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree is used as the initial path scheme and insertion operator. Then, the proposed algorithm introduces a deletion operator to increase the path length, removes the crossover operator which has little contribution to the path optimization, and takes the trajectory of other UAVs in the cluster as the constraint condition in the planning. Finally, the improved genetic algorithm is applied to the cooperative path planning of multi-UAV. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional genetic algorithm, the path length of the improved genetic algorithm is reduced by 38%, and the time consumption of the improved genetic algorithm is reduced by 77%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Collaborative path planning; Genetic algorithm; Multi-UAV","Antennas; Clustering algorithms; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Collaborative path planning; Complex environments; Cooperative works; Longest path; Mission requirements; Multi UAV; Pathlengths; Rapidly-exploring random trees; Research topics; Traditional genetic algorithms; Genetic algorithms","C.

An increasing research effort has been devoted to trajectory prediction for non-cooperative UAVs to facilitate their collision avoidance and trajectory planning. Existing methods for UAV trajectory prediction typically suffer from two major drawbacks: inadequate uncertainty quantification of the impact of external factors (e.g., wind) and inability to perform online detection of abrupt flying pattern changes. This paper proposes a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based trajectory prediction framework for UAVs featuring three novel components: 1) GPR with uniform confidence bounds for simultaneous predictive uncertainty quantification, 2) online trajectory change-point detection, and 3) adaptive training data pruning. The paper also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed framework to competing trajectory prediction methods via numerical studies using both simulation and real-world datasets. © 2021 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

However, the limited battery capacity of the UAV restricts its application on many occasions, e.g., the networks deployed in the wild. In this paper, we propose a cooperative trajectory planning scheme to deal with the energy issue of the UAV, where a truck carrying backup batteries moves along with the UAV acting as a 'mobile recharging station'. Our optimization task is to minimize the total mission time for gathering data from all the sensor nodes, which can be achieved by solving two problems: First, we need to divide the entire mission area into multiple subregions so that the UAV can hover over each subregion to collect the data of the sensor nodes through just one taking-off and landing under the constraint of battery capacity; second, we should find out the optimal trajectory of the truck so that the UAV can get to the hovering positions of each subregion from the truck and fly back to it before the battery drains considering the road condition in real world. We introduce an efficient clustering algorithm to partition the area into subregions in a load-balanced way to minimize the number of movements of the UAV. The trajectory planning task is formulated as a coordinated traveling salesman problem, which is solved by a three-step trajectory planning algorithm heuristically, and we also give the analysis of the upper bound and lower bound to demonstrate the performance guarantee. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme provides an effective and cost-efficient way for the data collection of large-scale wireless sensor networks in practical scenarios.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Data collection; trajectory planning; unmanned aerial vehicles; wireless sensor network","Antennas; Clustering algorithms; Job analysis; Secondary batteries; Sensor nodes; Trajectories; Traveling salesman problem; Trucks; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Battery capacity; Data collection; ITS applications; Large-scale wireless sensor networks; Planning scheme; Relay; Task analysis; Trajectory Planning; Data acquisition","S.

Under the hood lies a novel optimization scheme for grid-based methods, utilizing Simulated Annealing algorithm, that significantly increases the achieved percentage of coverage and improves the qualitative features of the generated paths. Extensive simulated evaluation in comparison with a state-of-the-art alternative methodology, for coverage path planning (CPP) operations, establishes the performance gains in terms of achieved coverage and overall duration of the generated missions. On top of that, DARP algorithm is employed to allocate sub-tasks to each member of the swarm, taking into account each UAV’s sensing and operational capabilities, their initial positions and any no-fly-zones possibly defined inside the operational area. This feature is of paramount importance in real-life applications, as it has the potential to achieve tremendous performance improvements in terms of time demanded to complete a mission, while at the same time it unlocks a wide new range of applications, that was previously not feasible due to the limited battery life of UAVs. In order to investigate the actual efficiency gains that are introduced by the multi-UAV utilization, a simulated study is performed as well. All of these capabilities are packed inside an end-to-end platform that eases the utilization of UAVs’ swarms in remote sensing applications. Its versatility is demonstrated via two different real-life applications: (i) a photogrametry for precision agriculture and (ii) an indicative search and rescue for first responders missions, that were performed utilizing a swarm of commercial UAVs.

Due to the limited energy and service capacity, it is very challenging for a single UAV to accomplish the data collection while guaranteeing the information freshness of IoT devices or sensor nodes (SNs). In practice, different types of UAVs may have different energy capabilities. In this paper, we propose a more practical heterogeneous UAV swarm path planning problem for optimizing the information freshness, in which the division and cooperation among UAVs with different energy capacities have been taken into consideration. The freshness, i.e., age of information (AoI) collected from each SN is characterized by the data uploading time and the time elapsed since the UAV leaves this SN. We successfully present a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on attention mechanism by end-to-end training to optimize the average age under UAVs' energy constraints. The simulation results show that our algorithm has fast convergence, high optimization capability and reliability, and can solve the heterogeneous UAV swarm cooperative AoI optimization problem effectively.  © 2022 IEEE.","age of information; heterogeneous network; path planning; UAV swarm","Antennas; Data acquisition; Deep learning; Heterogeneous networks; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Sensor nodes; Aerial vehicle; Age of information; Data collection; Energy-capacity; Limited energies; Optimisations; Reinforcement learnings; Service capacity; Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm; Vehicle applications; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","X.

In the air-ground collaborative disaster relief scenario proposed in this article, a UAV path planning framework based on binary particle swarm algorithm(BPSO) is proposed to solve the UAV trajectory planning problem in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks. The framework proposed in this paper realizes path planning for the dynamic allocation of data transmission time and acquisition energy consumption between collection nodes and UAVs. The time of data transmission and the energy consumption of collection nodes for UAV are the constraints. Considering the data migration of the underlying network(WSN), aiming at maximizing the value of data utilization. The simulation experiments validated the good performance in terms of integrity and efficiency. Compared with the algorithm that does not consider the underlying network data migration, the algorithm proposed in this paper can maximize the energy utilization efficiency of the UAV. In this paper, the data migration of the underlying network is considered, and a node is completely collected, which ensures the integrity of the data, and the performance is 55.19% better than the algorithm without considering the integrity. At the same time, as for collection efficiency, the performance of the framework is 38.04% better than the greedy algorithm, 18.55% better than the OR-Tools path planning algorithm proposed by Google, and 48.07% better than the straight algorithm. It has important theoretical significance and application value.  © 2022 IEEE.","Air-ground Collaborative Disaster Relief; BPSO; Data collection; Path Planning; UAV-WSN","Antennas; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Disaster prevention; Emergency services; Energy utilization; Motion planning; Sensor nodes; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aerial vehicle; Air grounds; Air-ground collaborative disaster relief; Binary particle swarm; Binary particle swarm algorithm; Data collection; Data-migration; Disaster relief; Particle swarm algorithm; Unmanned aerial vehicle -wireless sensor network; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","R.

The kinematic UAV model with dual-input including commanded speed and heading rate is adopted, and the unknown target state is forecasted by the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with probability estimate. The cooperative path planning with multiple objectives and priorities is designed, where the infrastructure occlusion to line of detection sight and energy consumption are considered. Three optimisation objectives are fuzzified, and the priority is modelled by the relaxed order of satisfactory degrees. With the synchronous communication, the collision avoidance constraints and compatibility constraints under communication delay are designed. Moreover, the obstacle avoidance constraints with high buildings are addressed. Based on the distributed receding horizon control (RHC), the fuzzy multi-objective synchronous cooperative tracking model is built, and the optimal path of UAVs can be obtained by regulating the parameter. The algorithm to find the bound of regulation parameter is developed based on Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) condition. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed method is effective and reliable. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","distributed receding horizon control; extended Kalman filter; fuzzy multi-objective optimisation; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Energy utilization; Extended Kalman filters; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Communication delays; Cooperative path planning; Cooperative tracking; Ground moving targets; Probability estimate; Receding horizon control; Satisfactory degree; Synchronous communications; Aircraft detection","C.

This is because cooperative robots are often used as risk-reduction tools to human life. For example, they are used to explore dangerous places such as minefields and disarm explosives. Drones can be used to perform tasks such as aerial photography, military and defense missions, agricultural surveys, etc. The bases of the cooperative robotic arms can be stationary, mobile (ground), or drones. Cooperative manipulators allow faster performance of assigned tasks because of the available “extra hand”. Furthermore, a mobile base increases the reachable ground workspace of cooperative manipulators while a drone base drastically increases this workspace to include the aerial space. The papers in this review are chosen to extensively cover a wide variety of cooperative manipulation tasks and industries that use them. In cooperative manipulation, avoiding self-collision is one of the most important tasks to be performed. In addition, path planning and formation control can be challenging because of the increased number of components to be coordinated. © 2021, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","aerial manipulator; Cooperative arms; cooperative tasks; drone base; mobile base; mobile manipulator","Aerial photography; Agricultural robots; Antennas; End effectors; Manipulators; Military photography; Robotic arms; Robotics; Surveys; Cooperative manipulations; Cooperative manipulator; Cooperative robotics; Cooperative robots; Cooperative tasks; Defense missions; Formation control; Number of components; Drones","L.P.

However, considering that the endurance of UAV itself is limited to a certain extent, and the terrain of the affected area is often complex, and there is a lot of information to be collected, Therefore, reasonable path planning is the key to improving the efficiency of UAV data collection. By analyzing the above background, it leads to the significance of UAV path planning in emergency scenarios. Then, starting from the path planning of a single UAV, the classic algorithms of path planning of a single UAV are investigated, and the basic ideas and algorithm flow are analyzed. Thirdly, given the characteristics of the need to improve the efficiency of information retrieval in emergency scenarios, it is analyzed that compared with a single UAV, multi-UAV has higher search efficiency, better system stability, and is easier to realize in practical application. Ant colony algorithm is used to realize the cooperative search of multiple UAVs. In this part, the modeling process, design idea, search principle, and other details of the algorithm are introduced in detail, and its advantages are analyzed. After that, the feasibility of the algorithm is verified by simulation, and the advantages compared with other algorithms are compared.

The network lifetime is restricted to battery lifetime of routers which are scattered over a complex post-disaster area. There is a potential to prolong the network lifetime by utilizing UAV mobility. We consider the trajectory planning of UAVs with the goal of maximizing the network lifetime, which is modeled as a cooperative game with complete information. However, the time complexity of the problem increases exponentially with the number of UAVs as well as UAV candidate strategies. In our proposal, we boost the game process by excluding some of candidates from the strategy space for each UAV. Specifically, there is no influence for a given UAV, taking the strategies excluded, over the other UAVs. In addition, these strategies are dominated by another strategy at least. Our proposed model is verified through simulations that show its advantage on time complexity over others. © 2020 IEEE.","Cooperative game; Mesh router networks; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Antennas; Complex networks; Disasters; Game theory; MESH networking; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Battery lifetime; Communication service; Complete information; Cooperative game; Natural disasters; Network lifetime; Trajectory Planning; Wireless routers; Routers","W.

Avoiding collision and simultaneous arrival of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) is also a great problem. This paper addresses the cooperative path planning of multi-UAVs with in a dynamic environment. To deal with the aforementioned issues, we combine the maximum-minimum ant colony optimization (MMACO) and Cauchy Mutant (CM) operators to make a bio-inspired optimization algorithm. Our proposed algorithm eliminates the limitations of classical ant colony optimization (ACO) and MMACO, which has the issues of the slow convergence speed and a chance of falling into local optimum. This paper chooses the CM operator to enhance the MMACO algorithm by comparing and examining the varying tendency of fitness function of the local optimum position and the global optimum position when taking care of multi-UAVs path planning problems. It also makes sure that the algorithm picks the shortest route possible while avoiding collision. Additionally, the proposed method is more effective and efficient when compared to the classic MMACO. Finally, the simulation experiment results are performed under the dynamic environment containing wind forces and tornadoes. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Ant colony optimization; Cauchy mutant operator and unmanned aerial vehicle; cooperative path planning","","Z.A.

The attention neural network is used to generate the cooperative reconnaissance strategy of the UAV, and a large amount of simulation data is tested to optimize the attention network using the REINFORCE algorithm.

In this paper, we consider a path planning optimization problem to maximize the collected data from multiple Internet of Things (IoT) nodes under realistic constraints. The considered multi-UAV non-cooperative scenarios involve random number of other UAVs in addition to the typical UAV, and UAVs do not communicate with each other. We translate the problem into an Markov decision process (MDP). Dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) is proposed to learn the decision making policy for the typical UAV, without any prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., channel propagation model and locations of the obstacles) and other UAVs (e.g., their missions, movements, and policies).

In a persistent surveillance task, the drones sometimes cannot complete it independently when some regions are required to be covered on the ground. For this purpose, unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles (UAVs UGVs) system is introduced to perform such a task in this article, and the goal is to generate the circular paths for the drones and the UGVs, respectively, to minimize their travel time of realizing a complete coverage. First, the cooperative path planning problem of UAVs UGVs is formulated into a large-scale 0-1 optimization problem, in which the on-off states of the discrete points are to be optimized. Second, a hybrid algorithm integrating the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and the genetic algorithm (GA) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The advantages of EDA and GA in the global and local search are fully taken considering the demands in different phases of the iterative process. A simple sweep-based approach is employed to determine the optimal sequence of passing the open points. Then, an online local adjustment strategy is also applied to address the changes of the requirements on covering the ground area. Simulation results demonstrate that the UAVs UGVs system can enhance the efficiency of the task. The hybrid EDA-GA algorithm can greatly improve the performance of EDA and GA in terms of the quality and the stability of solutions. The online adjustment strategy is effective to maintain a complete coverage while minimizing the impact on the circular paths. © 2014 IEEE.","cooperative path planning; Drones; hybrid EDA-GA algorithm; persistent surveillance; UGV; urban environments","Antennas; Drones; Ground vehicles; Iterative methods; Monitoring; Travel time; Urban planning; Complete coverages; Cooperative path planning; Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA); On-line adjustment; Optimization problems; Persistent surveillance; Stability of solutions; Unmanned ground vehicles; Genetic algorithms","Y.

The strategy includes two parts: task assignment and path planning. In the first part, an equallydivided course vertical line (ECVL) search arithmetic is designed, which can make the search resources evenly distributed in the area and improve the efficiency of cooperative search. In the second part, an improved artificial potential field (IAPF) method is designed to avoid collisions between multi-UAV and ensure flight safety.

A novel method for multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance mission planning in denied environment (MUCRMP-DE) based on an improved synthetic heuristic algorithm is proposed to tackle these. In this paper, a hierarchical model is established with the global optimization goal of UAV's minimum radar detection time at first, including the planning of reconnaissance sequence between and within target groups, as well as relative position to targets. Then an improved synthetic heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the model, which obtains valuable reconnaissance mission plan. For an application example of reconnaissance mission involving 68 targets, the simulation results show that the improved synthetic heuristic algorithm can suit the needs of the mission, particularly in effectively evading the detection of multiple radars. While it can also give better anti-radar attributes to the UA V and efficiently improved the convergence speed in the specific reconnaissance mission.  © 2021 IEEE.","Denied Environment; Heuristic Algorithm; Mission Planning; Multi-UAV Cooperative Reconnaissance","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Global optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Hierarchical systems; Military vehicles; Motion planning; Tracking radar; Convergence rates; Denied environment; Heuristics algorithm; Mission planning; Mission planning problem; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative reconnaissance; Novel methods; Reconnaissance mission; Slow convergences; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166541627-6","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Immediate, safe, effective and environmentally friendly measures must be adopted to reduce the impact of the oil spill on marine life. Due to the difficulty to detect and clean these areas, semi-autonomous vehicles can make a significant contribution by implementing a cooperative and coordinated response. The paper proposes a concept study of Hybrid Monitoring Detection and Cleaning System (HMDCS-UV) for a maritime region using semi-autonomous unmanned vehicles. This system is based on a cooperative decision architecture for an unmanned aerial vehicle to monitor and detect dirty zones (i.e., hydraulic spills), and clean them up using a swarm of unmanned surface vehicles. The proposed solutions were implemented in a real cloud and were evaluated using different simulation scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed HMDCS-UV can detect and reduce the level of hydraulic pollution in maritime regions with a significant gain in terms of energy consumption. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Detection; Hybrid architecture; Swarm; Trajectory planning; UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle); USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle)","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Energy utilization; Marine pollution; Oil spills; Petroleum industry; Petroleum transportation; Autonomous unmanned vehicles; Cleaning system; Concept studies; Difficulty to detect; Marine life; Production and transportations; Semi-autonomous vehicles; Remotely operated vehicles","S.

In distributed fault-tolerant control system, each UAV system contains a layered controller divided into two layers. The upper layer is a virtual system, which deals with the issues of track planning, formation control and cooperative communication among multiple UAVs. The lower layer is a real system, which deals with the track tracking and fault tolerance of a single UAV system. The complex multi-UAV group collaboration problem is decoupled into the fault tolerance problem of a single UAV. In the virtual system, the flight path planning and formation control algorithm plan the formation path and formation of UAV, and give the ideal state of each UAV. The real system of the lower layer tracks the ideal state of the UAV through the track tracking algorithm. When a UAV in the formation fails to track the ideal state, the uav will quit the formation. Since the real UAV system only receives the status information from the virtual system and does not transmit the information to the virtual system, the fault information is avoided to spread in the formation.  © 2021 IEEE.","Distributed; Fault tolerant control; UAV formation","Aircraft control; Aircraft detection; Cooperative communication; Fault tolerance; Flight control systems; Motion planning; Control problems; Distributed; Faults tolerant controls; Formation control; Multi UAV; Quad rotors; Real systems; UAV formation; UAV systems; Virtual systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","L.

The messenger UAV needs to visit each UGV to collect and share information. The aim of this problem is to achieve a shortest path which makes the UAV fly over all UGVs while avoiding obstacles. By the Dubins model, the path planning problem is formulated as a Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood (DDTSPN) under obstacle constraints. To adapt to the change of UGVs' locations and reduce the complexity of tuning global path for obstacle avoidance, a moving horizon optimization strategy is porposed. After the UAV visits a UGV, the rest of UGVs' access sequence and access locations are determined using SOM method according to the real-time locations of UGVs. Further, the DAPF algorithm is presented to replan the path which enters the obstacle regions. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed path planning algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.","DAPF; Dubins path planning; Dynamic target points; Messenger mechanism; Obstacle area; SOM","Antennas; Ground vehicles; Location; Traveling salesman problem; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Avoiding obstacle; Collaborative systems; Dynamic target; Moving horizon optimization; Path planning problems; Path-planning algorithm; Real-time location; Unmanned ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","Y.

The group learning strategy is introduced in map and compass operator to reduce computation complexity and enhance the global search ability. At the same time, the triple mutations strategy is employed in landmark operator to enhance swarm diversity. What’s more, in order to synchronize multi-UAV, the time stamp segmentation technique is designed to prove waypoints, which can simplify the cost function by reducing the number of independent variables. Besides, we geometric the threat sources to quantify their dangerous level. The coordination costs can guarantee collision-free flight and real-time communication. Finally, the proposed method is applied to path planning in set scenarios.

Multiple UAVs usually cooperate in the form of teams to improve the efficiency of mission execution. The UAVs are equipped with multiple sensors with complementary functions to adapt to the complex mission constraints. Reasonable task assignment, task scheduling, and UAV trajectory planning are the prerequisites for efficient cooperation of multi-functional heterogeneous UAVs. In this paper, a multi-swarm fruit fly optimization algorithm (MFOA) with dual strategy switching is proposed to solve the multi-functional heterogeneous UAV cooperative mission planning problem with the criterion of simultaneously minimizing the makespan and the total mission time. First, the multi-swarm mechanism is introduced to enhance the global search capability of the fruit fly optimization algorithm. Second, in the smell-based search phase, the local search strategies and large-scale search strategies are designed to drive multiple fruit fly swarms, and the dual strategy switching method is presented. Third, in the vision-based search stage, the greedy selection strategy is adopted. Finally, numerical simulation experiments are designed. The simulation results show that the MFOA algorithm is more effective and stable for solving the multi-functional heterogeneous UAV cooperative mission planning problem compared with other algorithms. © 2020 by the authors.

However, a major limitation of existing UAV systems is their limited flight endurance. To address this issue, by implementing the auto-rechargeable mechanism, we explicitly optimize hardware setting and system strategy required for regional SP with predefined initial tasks and stochastic incidents by solving a heuristic facility location problem and multi-objective path planning problem based on cooperative auto-recharging facilities, and fleet management center. The proposed fleet size and system performance are leveraged in a grid network with respect to different infrastructure settings and service coverage.

In this paper, we present E2Coop, a new scheme designed to avoid collisions for UAV swarms by tightly coupling Artificial Potential Field (APF) with Particle Swarm Planning (PSO) based trajectory planning. In E2Coop, swarm members perform trajectory planning cooperatively to avoid collisions in an energy-efficient manner. E2Coop exploits the advantages of the active contour model in image processing for trajectory planning. Each swarm member plans its trajectories on the contours of the environment field to save energy and avoid collisions to obstacles. Swarm members that fall within the safeguard distance of each other plan their trajectories on different contours to avoid collisions with each other. Simulation results demonstrate that E2Coop can save energy up to 51% compared with two state-of-the-art schemes.

[Methods] Keep-in and keep-out geo-fences are used to carry out scene modelling, and the problems of threat and obstacle avoidance are transformed into geo-fence constraints. Aiming at collision avoidance and continuous communication link between vehicles, a judgment criterion for the constraints of collision avoidance and communication link via time sequence detection is proposed. The average travel time (ATT) of the swarm is taken as the path optimization function, and the multiple constraints are transformed into penalty functions. A self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm is adopted to solve the optimization problem. [Results] The proposed method can ensure safe navigation and communication link between USV and UAV swarms in hostile and obstacle-filled environment, and achieve the shortest ATT under multiple constraints. [Conclusions] This method has practical value for the off-line path planning of UMV swarms in the hostile and obstacle-filled environment. © 2021 Editorial Department of Chinese Journal of Ship Research.

The problem further complicates itself in the context of autonomous multi-UAV trajectory planning considering conflict avoidance for future city applications. To tackle this problem, this paper introduces the multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning (MCTP) problem, and proposes a bilevel model for the problem. The upper level is modeled as an extended multiple traveling salesman problem, aiming at generating trajectories based on heuristic framework for multi-UAV task allocation and scheduling and meanwhile considering UAV kinodynamic properties. The lower level is modeled as a holding time assignment problem to avoid possible spatiotemporal trajectory conflicts, where conflict time difference is analyzed based on the proposed state-time graph method. Numerical studies are conducted in both a 1 km2 virtual city and 12 km2 real city with a set of tasks and obstacles settings. The results show that the proposed model is capable of planning trajectories for multi-UAV from the system-level perspective based on the proposed method. © 2021 by the authors.

Apart from the random noises from sensors, the localization performance is much dependent on their cooperative trajectories. In our previous work, we have proposed a cooperative trajectory generating method that proves better than EKF based method. In this letter, an improved online trajectory generating method is proposed to enhance the previous one. First, the least square estimation method has been replaced with a geometric-optimization based estimation method, which can obtain a better estimation performance than the least square method proposed in our previous work; second, in the trajectory optimization phase, the position error caused by estimation method is also considered, which can further improve the optimization performance of the next way points of the two UAVs. The improved method can well be applied to the two-UAV trajectory planning for corporative target localization, and the simulation results confirm that the improved method achieves an obviously better localization performance than our previous method and the EKF-based method.

The ferry UAVs act as message collectors and throwers in the network to improve data transmission efficiency, the critical roles that ferry plays have made them the target of sophisticated attacks, ferry should be protected, otherwise, routing efficiency and data delivery of the network will be affected. Since the movement mode of ferry nodes is different from the ordinary nodes, this paper attempts to distinguish ordinary node and ferry node through trajectory analysis, then we propose a Trajectory-based message Ferry Recognition Attack (TFRA) which is easy for an attacker to implement, using the idea of trajectory clustering to distinguish the trajectory of the ferry node, and obtain the location for further attacks. At the same time, we conducted a systematic study on the existing path planning scheme of ferry node, and summarized several typical types of message ferry path planning schemes, then evaluated the performance of TFRA in these schemes. The results show TFRA can attack ferry nodes with high accuracy and recognition rate. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Message ferry recognition; Trajectory clustering; UAV network","Cooperative communication; Efficiency; Motion planning; Trajectories; Data transmission efficiency; Message ferries; Message ferry recognition; Multiple UAVs; Planning scheme; Recognition attacks; Routing efficiency; Trajectory clustering; Trajectory-based; UAV network; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Y.

As the ground target motion is in 3D, we have developed a Model-Predictive control based framework for tracking the convoy taking the terrain restriction, kinematic constraints of the UAV and the camera field-of-view into account. Due to these constraints, it may not be possible for a single UAV to track the convoy continuously and hence we develop a cooperative multi-UAV framework with two UAVs to ensure continuous tracking.

Most existing tracking solutions using online path planning focus on general target trajectories. Such trajectories have strong regularity and are smooth with minimal fluctuations. However, in real UAV applications a target will change its trajectory frequently to prevent from being tracked, and thus its trajectory will fluctuate greatly and randomly. To this end, in this paper we consider a realistic scenario where the UAV target trajectory is changeable and random. For real-time target tracking, we formulate the tracking task as a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem, the objective of which is to optimize tracking performance under various constraints. To do so, we innovatively combine the adaptive differential evolution (ADE) algorithm with Nash optimization, and then propose a Nash-combined ADE method. Specifically, we use ADE to adaptively adjust the predicted trajectory of each UAV agent and Nash optimization to efficiently solve DMPC formulation for global optimization, which can improve the tracking accuracy and simultaneously reduce the computational complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs well in terms of tracking accuracy, UAV collision avoidance and tracking stability for realistic target trajectories.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","adaptive differential evolution (ADE); changeable and random trajectory; distributed model predictive control (DMPC); nash optimization; Online path planning","Antennas; Clutter (information theory); Evolutionary algorithms; Global optimization; Model predictive control; Multi agent systems; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Adaptive differential evolution (ADE); Adaptive differential evolutions; Distributed Artificial Intelligence; Distributed Model predictive Control; On-line path planning; Real-time target tracking; Tracking performance; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; Aircraft detection","S.

In the last decade, the increase in the capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), paired with a drop in their price, has led them to be used in many different applications where they are employed for their versatility and efficiency. A challenge that is being addressed in this field is that of autonomous UAVs fleets, i.e., the coordinated use of multiple UAVs to perform a common task. A particularly interesting application of UAV fleets is their use in the exploration and mapping of unknown or critical environments. This topic brings with it a significant number of challenges, from the design of the policy used to coordinate the fleet to the path planning algorithm that each UAV uses to move in the environment while exploring it. In this paper, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach for the cooperative exploration of unknown environments by a fleet of UAVs is presented. Two RL agents are trained to address this problem: The first has the task of coordinating the exploration task, optimizing the way the UAVs spread in the unknown area by assigning some waypoints to them. The waypoints are placed in order to optimize the distribution of the fleet and to maximize the exploration process efficiency. The second RL agent is a path planning algorithm and is used by each UAV to move in the environment to reach the region pointed by the first agent. The combined use of the two agents allows the fleet to coordinate in the execution of the exploration task. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

We focus on the online and decentralized path planning for the solar-powered UAV team. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem which forces the UAVs to complete the uninterrupted eavesdropping task, not enter any No-fly space (NFS), keep a safe distance from each other and harvest as much energy as possible. We propose a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) based path planning method, consisting of an initial planning phase and an online planning phase. In the online planning phase, each UAV plans its own path based on the shared information across the team. Since the UAV model can be taken into account in the planning phase, the obtained UAV paths are feasible without any later adjustment.

Among the cooperative-based UAV applications, this paper considers the protection of Convoy of Ground Mobile Vehicles (CGMV). The sketched problem is a canonical problem that requires coordinating a team of UAVs including their movements, tasks, and balancing resources. In this regard, we propose an efficient task allocation scheme. Besides that, the suggested approach is based on a hybrid strategy combining the circular path and the path ahead protection strategies involving two UAV sets. The first UAV set performs a circular path encircling all the vehicles in the convoy and protects them from the potential threats on the two lateral sides. The second UAV set explores the path ahead of the convoy. The conceived convoy protection scheme, called CGMVP-CUAVs, is validated by simulation using the NetLogo3D environment. Different experiments were conducted to analyze the efficiency of the proposed approach. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of our strategy. © 2021 IEEE.","Convoy protection; Cooperative UAVs; Path planning; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Antennas; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Military applications; Military vehicles; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Canonical problems; Circular paths; Convoy protection; Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle; Hybrid strategies; Mobile vehicle; Protection strategy; Task allocation; Vehicle applications; Vehicle-based systems; Motion planning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-073811316-6","","","English","Int.

This paper presents an UAV/ UGV scheduling problem in which the UAV needs to be recharged by the UGV in order to working in persistent tasks, and meanwhile, the UGV need to visits UGV working depots. Two different problem are presented: fixed charging sets problem (FCSP) and discrete charging sets problem (DCSP). In FCSP, charging sets are fixed, and a two-stage travelling salesman problem method is proposed to solve the problem. DCSP is a modification of FCSP while charging segments are discrete into serval segments, an graph transformation approach was proposed to transform DCSP into GTSP, so DCSP can be resolved by using GTSP solvers. Simulation results shows that both DCSP and FCSP can ensure UAV/UGV work in persistent tasks, and the graph transformation algorithm can efficiently transform DCSP into GTSP. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020","","Drones; Graph algorithms; Graph theory; Manufacture; Autonomous navigation; Collaborative systems; Discrete charging; Graph Transformation; Human intervention; Intelligent Manufacturing; Scheduling problem; Travelling salesman problem; Traveling salesman problem","H.

A promising strategy to achieve a successful landing in this heterogeneous rendezvous maneuver is the subdivision of the synchronization control task into a trajectory planner and underlying trajectory tracking controllers. For this purpose, a central trajectory planner, which is the subject of this paper, computes feasible trajectories for the UAV and UGV that converge towards each other. Current approaches mainly rely either on computationally expensive optimization problems or on potentially inaccurate linearization. In this paper, a new model predictive trajectory planning scheme based on the flatness property of kinematic models of the fixed-wing UAV and UGV is presented. By using vehicle models with this property, quadratic programs (QP) are formulated that can be solved efficiently in each time instance without linearization of the nonlinear vehicle models, which is a novel approach in this application. Crucial requirements for the trajectory planner are that it reduces the horizontal distance between the vehicles to below 0.5 m while maintaining safety constraints to allow safe landing, and a sampling rate of 40 Hz to allow rapid replanning in case of disturbances. To overcome the issue of input constraint transformation between the original and the flat models, different approximation methods are investigated. Simulation results with simple kinematic vehicle models and high-fidelity dynamic models using underlying trajectory tracking controllers and navigation filters are presented that demonstrate that the proposed trajectory planning method allows safe landing maneuvers with the considered vehicle setup. © 2021 IEEE.","","Antennas; Application programs; Controllers; Fixed wings; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Kinematics; Landing; Linearization; Quadratic programming; Trajectories; Autonomous landing; Linearisation; Model predictive; Property; Safe landing; Spatial synchronization; Trajectory Planning; Trajectory tracking controllers; Vehicle modelling; Vehicle system; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172815394-0","","","English","IEEE Intell Veh Symp Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118842104"

The use of UAVs to map the environment and also to obtain remote information can benefit the rescue tasks. This paper proposes an organizational system for multi-UAVs to map indoor environments that have been affected by a natural disaster. The robot’s organization is focused on avoiding possible collisions between swarm’s members, and also to prevent searching in locations that have already discovered. This organizational approach is inspired by bees behavior. Thus, the multi- UAVs must search, in a collaborative way, in order to map the scenario in the shortest possible time and, consequently, to travel the shortest reasonable distance. Therefore, three strategies were evaluated in a simulation scenario created in the V-REP software. The results indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach and compare the three plans based on the number of locations discovered and the path taken by each UAV. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Collaborative environment mapping; Multiple UAV; Path planning; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Automation; Computer software; Disasters; Soft computing; Environment mapping; Indoor environment; Multi UAV; Natural disasters; Optimization approach; Organizational system; Task planning; Unknown environments; Process control","R.

In the considered system, the drone acts as an orchestrator, coordinating the transmissions and the learning schedule within a predefined deadline. The actual schedule is reflected in a planned path: as the drone traverses it, it controls the distance and thereby the data rate to each node. Hence, the model is structured such that the drone orchestrator uses the path (trajectory) as its only tool to achieve fairness in terms of learning staleness, which reflects the learning time discrepancy among the nodes. Using the number of learning epochs performed at each learner as a performance indicator, we combine the average number of epochs computed and staleness into a balanced optimization criterion that is agnostic to the underlying FL implementation. We consider two methods for solving the complex trajectory planning optimization problem for static nodes: (1) successive convex programming (SCP) and (2) deep reinforcement learning (RL). Considering the proposed criterion, both methods are compared in three specific scenarios with few nodes. The results show that drone-orchestrated FL outperforms an immobile deployment by providing improvements in the range of 57% to 87.7%. Additionally, RL-guided trajectories are generally superior to SCP provided ones for complex node arrangements. © 2020 IEEE.","convex approximation; drone small cells; Drone trajectory optimization; edge computing; federated learning; reinforcement learning; staleness minimization; unmanned aerial vehicles; wireless communications","Convex optimization; Deep learning; Drones; Reinforcement learning; Trajectories; Transmissions; Average numbers; Complex trajectories; Learning schedule; Learning time; Optimization criteria; Performance indicators; Planned paths; Wireless link; Learning systems","I.

The goal is to maximize the combinational coverage area of drones while giving preference to the area that hasn’t been visited beyond a certain time interval. The influence of shooting resolution and blocking of buildings are considered, and the state information of each grid is defined to record the visit information of the ground area. Considering the characteristic of the established model, the multi-constrained cooperative path planning (MCCPP) algorithm is developed. The grids which have not been visited for a long time are received special attentions, and the drone is led to reducing the flight height to cover the gird which has a special requirement on the shooting resolution. The cooperation mechanism among drones is also set to ensure that all the drones can determine the next path point synchronously. An emergency path planning algorithm with the continuous checking strategy is designed for a drone to fly to the specified area and finish a complete coverage of it. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cooperative path planning; Drones; Emergency path planning; Persistent surveillance; Urban environments","","Y.

The goal is to generate safe trajectories inside a predefined volume, which is approved for the aerospace operations. It is assumed that the evading vehicle can determine its own state in real time, and estimate the intruder’s largest size and center of mass position using on-board sensors. In addition, it is assumed that the intruder’s information is available at a much slower rate or not available at all for a some time intervals. The evading vehicle has to travel between given way points, while avoiding the collision and satisfying given constraints. In the meantime, it has to stay as close to the given path as possible during the avoidance maneuvers. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the aerial vehicle’s position and velocity, and intruder’s position at the detection/estimation time instance, assuming that the intruder’s maximum possible velocity is known. The presented approach relies on an analytical solution of the differential game problem formulated for two point masses with constraints imposed on the velocities, and generates a safe trajectory on a plane defined by the UAS and non-cooperative airborne dynamic obstacle positions at the measurement instance, and the target way point. This trajectory separates the approved volume into safe and unsafe flight regions along the normal direction to its plane. Then the tree based path planning is applied to generate safe path inside the safe region taking into account UAV dynamics. The process is repeated as soon as a new information on the intruder’s position becomes available. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The proposed method provides a novel approach in which closing speed and approximate time-to-go terms are used in the reward function to obtain cooperative motion while ensuring no-fly-zones (NFZs) and time-of-arrival constraints. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used in the training phase of the RL agent. System performance is evaluated in two different cases. In case 1, the warfare environment contains only the target area, and simultaneous arrival is desired to obtain the saturated attack effect. In case 2, the warfare environment contains NFZs in addition to the target area and the standard saturated attack and collision avoidance requirements. Particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based cooperative path planning algorithm is implemented as the baseline method, and it is compared with the proposed algorithm in terms of execution time and developed performance metrics. Monte Carlo simulation studies are performed to evaluate the system performance. According to the simulation results, the proposed system is able to generate feasible flight paths in real-time while considering the physical and operational constraints such as acceleration limits, NFZ restrictions, simultaneous arrival, and collision avoidance requirements. In that respect, the approach provides a novel and computationally efficient method for solving the large-scale cooperative path planning for UCAV fleets. © 2021 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Space agencies, companies, and universities accept the challenge of studying solutions to enable human exploration of the cosmos.This paper illustrates the work performed during the IGLUNA ESALab@CH Field Campaign, an activity coordinated by Space Innovation (Previous Swiss Space Center). The IGLUNA analogue mission is a testbed to demonstrate technologies for future lunar exploration. The CoRoDro team was in charge to build an exploration system for the lunar lava tubes, a possible shelter for humans in the equatorial zone of the Moon. In the lava tubes, the main challenge is the inability for humans to visually track and communicate with robotic systems. Two earth analogues were used to demonstrate a lunar rover's and a thruster propelled hopper's autonomous navigation operation: a small rover and a drone performing short flights to simulate the hopper. In the lava tube, the two systems will collaborate to analyze and provide a map of its internal structure. The hopper will provide a map thanks to its propelled flights to the rover that will avoid obstacles in the lava tube to reach highinterest areas for analyzing.This concept has been proved during the IGLUNA field campaign that occurred on top of Mount Pilatus (Switzerland). This paper is focusing on presenting the path planning and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) algorithms implemented on both robots. The drone relies on path planning algorithms to explore the unknown environment while the SLAM algorithms generate the map. Pathplanning on the drone acquires the boundaries and establishes the covering path of the exploration area.The SLAM algorithms contain several modules that take into consideration the mobility capabilities of the rover to create a map that mentions obstacles and reachable areas for the rover. The map is shared with the rover and used to reach targets identified by the drone. Taking into account obstacles, targets, risks and rewards, an optimum global path is generated. SLAM and path planning algorithms allow the rover to update the map and also detect the obstacles that were not detected by the drone. This work has been reviewed by experts from ESA, Space Innovation, Airbus; an analysis of its performance is presented in this paper. It has shown the interest of fully autonomous robotic missions in extreme and remote conditions, encountered both in space and on Earth.

However, the existing methods cannot guarantee rigorous safety performance. This paper proposed a risk-bounded cooperative path planning model for multi-UAVs based on chance constrained optimization. The solution to path planning model via two phases: producing paths to meet the curvature constraints-the flyable paths, and then tuning the flyable safety paths to meet the safety level on demand. By employing the deterministic equivalence method to solve the formulated chance-constrained optimization, the optimal paths of multi-UA Vs are achieved and the probability of collision is limited to a prefixed confidence level. The numerical simulations reveal the effectiveness of the proposed model, and demonstrate its risk-aware capabilities are better than that of without using the chance constrained optimization. © 2021 IEEE.","chance constrained; multi-UAVs cooperative path planning; risk-bounded; uncertainty","Constrained optimization; Safety engineering; Chance-constrained; Chance-constrained optimizations; Cooperative path planning; Crash risk; Flight efficiency; Multi UAV; Multi-UAV cooperative path planning; Planning models; Risk-bounded; Uncertainty; Motion planning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-073814657-7","","","English","Proc.

After the occurrence of earthquake disasters, the key to disaster monitoring and rescue is to quickly obtain images of postdisaster areas. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning is the core of multi-UAV cooperative control. With the increasing popularity of UAVs, people with more complex living environments contact with UAVs more frequently, which also poses a challenge to the overall control of UAVs, making single UAV and even multi-UAV cooperative path planning become a hot research issue in recent years. The complexity of communication between aircraft in three-dimensional flight space and multidegree of freedom navigation makes multi-UAV cooperation more challenging. According to the research results at home and abroad, this paper takes multitarget tracking algorithm, ant colony algorithm, and hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm as research methods. Based on virtual reality technology, by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of several algorithms, the research model of path optimization is established, and a multitarget detection method based on virtual reality technology is established. Through the analysis and improvement of multitarget tracking algorithm, ant colony algorithm, and hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm, the path optimization problem of UAV after an earthquake based on virtual reality technology is studied. The results show that, compared with the previous research models, the overall optimization efficiency of UAV route is improved by 15%, which is more practical. © 2021 Yi Wang and Ensheng Liu.","","Air navigation; Aircraft accidents; Aircraft detection; Ant colony optimization; Antennas; Disasters; Earthquakes; Motion planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Virtual reality; Aerial vehicle; Ant colonies algorithm; Disaster monitoring; Disaster rescue; Earthquake disaster; Hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm; Multitarget tracking algorithms; Path optimizations; Research models; Virtual reality technology; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","E.

This paper focuses on the problem of multi-UAV's Coverage Path Planning (mCPP) to exploit all points of interests within an area based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), where each UAV starts with a random position and carries a camera during the mission. There have been a number of optimal algorithms proposed for the coverage path planning of single UAV, however, it is under-explored for multiple UAVs. As such, we leverage Deep reinforcement learning with Double Q-learning Networks (DDQN) to learn a global optimal control policy for a team of UAVs under certain power constraints to cooperate effectively to explore a wider area. Regarding the task area as a 2D plane, we divide it into a collection of uniform grid cells, which represent a section of the environment. The camera field of view of each UAV covers a cell area underneath the UAV. Simulation results demonstrate that wherever the start positions are, the UAV cluster can fully cover the whole task area under the energy constraints and achieve autonomous collaboration. The proposed method has great potential in applying to dynamic environment. © 2021 IEEE.","DDQN; energy constraints; full coverage; mCPP; UAV cluster system","Antennas; Cameras; Cluster analysis; Deep learning; Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Cluster-based; Clusters system; Coverage path planning; DDQN; Energy constraint; Full coverage; Multi UAV; Multi-UAV coverage path planning; Multiple UAVs; Unmanned aerial vehicle cluster system; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166540605-5","","","English","IEEE Int.

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits.  © 2020 IEEE.","Internet of Things (IoT); map-based planning; multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL); trajectory planning; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Cooperative communication; Data acquisition; Deep learning; Fertilizers; Harvesting; Internet of things; Markov processes; Multi agent systems; Network architecture; Sensor nodes; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles; Collection performance; Dense urban environments; Flexible path planning; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Partially observable Markov decision process; Path planning problems; Reinforcement learning","H.

Due to the indeterminacy of sensors, distributed cooperative swarms have been considered to be efficient and robust but challenging to design and test. To facilitate the development of distributed swarms, it has been proposed to utilise a simulation platform for cooperative UAVs using imperfect perception. However, the existing simulation platforms cannot satisfy this demand due to a few reasons. First, they are designed for a specific purpose, and their functionalities are difficult to extend. Second, the existing platforms lack compatibility to be applied to different types of scenarios. Third, the modelling of these platforms is too simplified to simulate flight motion dynamic and noisy communication accurately, which may cause a difference in performance between the simulation and real-world application. To address the mentioned issues, this paper models the problem and proposes a simulation platform for distributed swarm cooperative perception, which addresses software engineering concerns and provides a set of extendable functionalities of a cooperative swarm, including communication, estimation, perception fusion, and path planning. The applicability of the proposed platform is verified by simulations with the real-world application. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system is viable.  © 2021 Haifeng Ling et al.","","Antennas; Computer software; Cooperative communication; Flight dynamics; Flight simulators; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles; Co-operative planning; Cooperative perception; Cooperative swarm; Design and tests; Emerging topics; Flight motion; Modelling and simulations; Simulation platform","H.

The construction of large-scale city-level 3D model will become another important medium after images and videos. We propose an autonomous approach to reconstruct the voxel model of the scene in real-time, and estimate the best set of viewing angles according to the precision requirement. These task views are assigned to the drones based on Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) optimization. In this process, the multi-level pipelining in the chip design method is applied to accelerate the parallelism between exploration and data acquisition. Our method includes: (1) real-time perception and reconstruction of scene voxel model and obstacle avoidance; (2) determining the best observation and viewing angles of scene geometry through global and local optimization; (3) assigning the task views to the drones and planning path based on the OMT optimization, and iterating continuously according to new exploration results; (4) expediting exploration and data acquisition in parallel through multi-stage pipeline to improve efficiency. Our method can schedule routes for drones according to the scene and its optimal acquisition perspective in real-time, which avoids the model void and lack of accuracy caused by traditional aerial 3D scanning using routes of cultivating land regardless of the object, and lays a solid foundation for the 3D real-life model to directly become the available 3D data source for AR and VR.

A main hindering factor for UGV navigation is the limited range of the on-board sensors that process only restricted areas of the environment at a time. In addition, most existing approaches process sensor information under the assumption of a static environment. This restrains the exploration capability of the UGV especially in time-critical applications such as search and rescue. The cooperation with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can provide the UGV with an extended perspective of the environment which enables a better-suited path planning solution that can be adjusted on demand. In this work, we propose a UAV-UGV cooperative path planning approach for dynamic environments by performing semantic segmentation on images acquired from the UAV's view via a deep neural network. The approach is evaluated in a car park scenario, with the goal of providing a path plan to an empty parking space for a ground-based vehicle. The experiments were performed on a created dataset of real-world car park images located in Croatia and Germany, in addition to images from a simulated environment. The segmentation results demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach in producing maps of the dynamic environment on demand and accordingly generating path plans for ground-based vehicles.  © 2020 University of Split, FESB.","cooperative path planning; neural networks; semantic image segmentation; unmanned aerial vehicle; unmanned ground vehicle","Antennas; Computer networks; Deep neural networks; Garages (parking); Ground vehicles; Image segmentation; Semantics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cooperative path planning; Dynamic environments; Ground-based vehicles; Semantic image segmentations; Semantic segmentation; Simulated environment; Time-critical applications; Unmanned ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","M.K.

Although users all expect to acquire their needed information in a short time, the degree of urgency to meet their demands is different when taking their diverse priorities into account. A priority-driven multiuser satisfaction model is designed, where users' satisfaction is quantified based on their different priorities, information acquisition demands, and the time they obtain their desired information. To ensure high priority users' fast information acquisition while avoiding excessive delay in low priority users' information acquisition, a batchwise information backhaul strategy is adopted. In each batch, a UAV is selected as the data ferry through a consultative mechanism to carry information back to users. This reconnaissance process is formulated as a cooperative path planning problem, where the optimization objective is maximizing users' total satisfaction, while an intelligent algorithm is proposed to solve this problem effectively. The simulation results show that compared with traditional path planning algorithms without considering user satisfaction, our proposed algorithm can guarantee faster information acquisition for users with higher priorities, which leads to higher satisfaction. In addition, the applicability of our proposed reconnaissance strategy and path planning algorithm in different situations is also analyzed. © 2021 Zeyuan Liu et al.","","Antennas; Motion planning; Batch-wise; Information acquisitions; Low priorities; Multiple user; Multiusers; Path-planning algorithm; Satisfaction model; User information; User priorities; Users' satisfactions; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","W.

Cooperative path planning (CPP) is a key problem for a UAV group in executing tasks collectively. In this paper, an attempt is made to perform a comprehensive review of the research on CPP for UAV groups. First, a generalized optimization framework of CPP problems is proposed from the viewpoint of three key elements, i.e., task, UAV group, and environment, as a basis for a comprehensive classification of different types of CPP problems. By following the proposed framework, a taxonomy for the classification of existing CPP problems is proposed to describe different kinds of CPPs in a unified way.

This kind of inspection task is called coverage path planning problem in 3D space. When the target to be detected is a large complex building, multi-UAV collaboration is usually required. So, how to obtain the optimal path of multi-UAV becomes a great challenge. In order to solve the problem, Asynchronous Ant Colony Optimization (AACO), which makes multiple ant colonies move forward asynchronously, is proposed here to conquer the difficulty. Firstly, the random sampling method is used to get the potential UAV waypoints in the 3D free environment, based on which a Primitive Coverage Graph (PCG) is constructed. Also, the visibility matrix and coverage rate are defined to quantify the coverage performance of UAV path primitives. Next, Asynchronous Ant Colony Optimization combined with reward strategy is proposed to solve the problem by selecting jump cities in turn. Finally, several simulations are provided to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm. © 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","3D Coverage Path Planning; Asynchronous Ant Colony Optimization; Path Primitive","Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 3D coverage; 3d coverage path planning; Ant colonies; Asynchronoi ant colony optimization; Building surface; Colony optimization; Coverage path planning; Multi UAV; Path primitive; Visual sensor; Ant colony optimization","Y.

Based on the centralized coordination architecture, this paper studies the cooperative time constraint problem of multiple UAVs and establishes a minimum snap trajectory planning model for a single UAV which converts the trajectory planning problem into a quadratic programming problem. A trajectory tracking controller is used to track the planned flight trajectory. In multi-UAV coordination with cooperative time constraints, coordination variables and coordination functions are selected as the multi-UAV cooperative strategy, and the time generated by the trajectory planning algorithm is used as the coordination variable. After the coordination function has coordinated the coordination variables, a unified time will be generated and returned to each UAV for replanning and tracking.

In all the areas one important key challenge is path planning which tells UAVs that where to fly and how to find a path. The Multiple consideration is to be considered for an ideal path planning which includes path completeness, optimality. The execution of path planning becomes a challenging task in terms of trajectory generation and also require careful consideration. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning techniques have been extensively studied and involve two key stages. First, 3-D objects and obstacles (static and dynamic) are identified. Second, these objects and obstacles are mapped to plan an appropriate path. In the context of UAVs, we can explain path planning techniques in terms of roadmaps/Voronoi diagrams (a representation technique), or we can adopt an optimization approach using either cooperative or non-cooperative techniques. These two approaches, and the techniques used in each, are summarized in terms of the key factors that have been discussed in the context of UAVs. This paper, enables future studies to easily compare with existing and previous studies.  © 2021 IEEE.","and Object Identification; Object Detection; Obstacle Avoidance; Optimal Path Planning; Optimal Path Selection; Path Planning Techniques; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Antennas; Intelligent computing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 3D object; Non-cooperative; Optimality; Optimization approach; Path planning techniques; Representation techniques; Systematic Review; Trajectory generation; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","A.

For reasons of changeable movement of target, the commanded speed and turning rate of each UAV are both taken as control input variables. In urban environment, buildings may occlude the line of sight of on-board sensor. Hence the target coverage degree is proposed as objective function instead of distance. To save energy of UAV system as much as possible, the control input cost and sensor energy consumption are also taken as objectives. For preemptive priority requirement, the objective functions are fuzzified and the satisfactory degree order is designed to model priority. To guarantee the feasibility of solution, the varying domain is introduced to replace the strict order constraint. On this basis, generalized varying domain (GVD) method is developed to balance optimization and priority. In terms of the maneuverability of UAVs, the diverse constraints are considered, including real speed and turning rate, control input saturation, collision avoidance between UAVs, and obstacle avoidance between UAV and buildings. Consequently, distributed model predictive control (DMPC) strategy is designed to calculate the optimal path of each UAV, where the state information in finite period of UAV is transferred to the adjacent ones. The simulations show the effectiveness of proposed method by comparing with hierarchical optimization (HO). © 2020, ICROS, KIEE and Springer.","Distributed model predictive control; path planning; priority; unmanned aerial vehicle","Aircraft control; Antennas; Energy utilization; Fixed wings; Maneuverability; Model predictive control; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Urban planning; Balance optimization; Control input saturation; Cooperative path planning; Distributed Model predictive Control; Ground moving targets; Hierarchical optimization; Path planning method; Satisfactory degree; Aircraft detection","C.

One of the most important civilian implementations of UAV/UGV cooperative path planning is delivering medical or emergency supplies during disasters such as wildfires, the focus of this paper. However, wildfires themselves pose risk to the UAVs/UGVs and their paths should be planned to avert the risk as well as complete the mission. In this paper, wildfire growth is simulated using a coupled Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model, widely used in literature for modeling wildfires, in a grid environment with added process and measurement noise. Using principles of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and with an appropriate choice of decomposition modes, a low-dimensional equivalent fire growth model is obtained for the deployment of the space–time Kalman Filtering (KF) paradigm for estimation of wildfires using simulated data. The KF paradigm is then used to estimate and predict the propagation of wildfire based on local data obtained from a camera mounted on the UAV. This information is then used to obtain a safe path for the UGV that needs to travel from an initial location to the final position while the UAV's path is planned to gather information on wildfire. Path planning of both UAV and UGV is carried out using a PDE based method that allows incorporation of threats due to wildfire and other obstacles in the form of risk function. The results from numerical simulation are presented to validate the proposed estimation and path planning methods. © 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics","State-estimation; Trajectory planning; UAV; UGV; Wild-fire","Antennas; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Numerical methods; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cooperative path planning; Coupled partial differential equations; Decomposition modes; Path planning method; Proper orthogonal decompositions; Research and development; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned ground vehicles; Fires","","","Elsevier B.V.","10009361","","CJAEE","","English","Chin J Aeronaut","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101794192"

Exploration missions with heterogeneous robot teams (HeRTs) should acquire a common map for understanding the surroundings better. The purpose of this paper is to provide a unique approach with cooperative use of agents that provides a well-detailed observation over the environment where challenging details and complex structures are involved. Also, this method is suitable for real-time applications and autonomous path planning for exploration. Design/methodology/approach: Lidar odometry and mapping and various similarity metrics such as Shannon entropy, Kullback–Leibler divergence, Jeffrey divergence, K divergence, Topsoe divergence, Jensen–Shannon divergence and Jensen divergence are used to construct a common height map of the environment. Furthermore, the authors presented the layering method that provides more accuracy and a better understanding of the common map. Findings: In summary, with the experiments, the authors observed features located beneath the trees or the roofed top areas and above them without any need for global positioning system signal. Additionally, a more effective common map that enables planning trajectories for both vehicles is obtained with the determined similarity metric and the layering method. Originality/value: In this study, the authors present a unique solution that implements various entropy-based similarity metrics with the aim of constructing common maps of the environment with HeRTs. To create common maps, Shannon entropy–based similarity metrics can be used, as it is the only one that holds the chain rule of conditional probability precisely. Seven distinct similarity metrics are compared, and the most effective one is chosen for getting a more comprehensive and valid common map. Moreover, different from all the studies in literature, the layering method is used to compute the similarities of each local map obtained by a HeRT. This method also provides the accuracy of the merged common map, as robots’ sight of view prevents the same observations of the environment in features such as a roofed area or trees. This novel approach can also be used in global positioning system-denied and closed environments. The results are verified with experiments. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Common maps; Height maps; Heterogeneous robot teams; Layering method; Similarity metrics; Surveillance and exploration robots","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Forestry; Global positioning system; Programmable robots; Conditional probabilities; Design/methodology/approach; Exploration missions; Global positioning; Heterogeneous robot teams; Real-time application; Similarity metrics; Unmanned ground vehicles; Ground vehicles","M.C.

Safe strategies are needed to control the motion of UAVs, and navigation decisions should be based mainly on onboard sensors observations for a fully autonomous operation. Developing such strategies is very challenging when considering dynamic environments with moving obstacles and other non-cooperative UAVs as usual path planning methods can be computationally unreliable. Hence, this work proposes a safe navigation control strategy based on the sense-and-avoid paradigm to allow for a reliable solution computational-wise. Bezier splines are used to generate motion paths which are manipulated in realtime reacting to current sensors observations resulting in a deformation-like effect to navigate safely around obstacles. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using the Gazebo simulator within a ROS framework, and good results were obtained for different simulation scenarios. © 2020 IEEE.","","Antennas; Collision avoidance; Deformation; Military applications; Military vehicles; Autonomous operations; Control strategies; Dynamic environments; Dynamic obstacles; Human interactions; Moving obstacles; Path planning method; Safe navigations; Navigation","T.

However, the area (e.g., rural) they fly over may have partial coverage, making the path planning of such UAV missions a challenging task. Recently a tolerable outage duration is taken into account for such UAVs, and the trajectory optimization under this outage duration is studied. However, these existing studies consider only a single UAV and focus on optimization of each UAV's own path separately even in multi-UAV scenarios. In this paper, we study the trajectory optimization problem for cellular-enabled UAVs by taking into account the collaboration among UAVs. That is, for a given set of UAVs, each with a mission to fly from a starting point to an ending point, we aim to optimize the total mission completion time for all UAVs such that none of them has a connection outage more than a threshold. We let UAVs collaborate and provide connectivity as relays to each other to solve their outage problem and shorten their trajectories. We first model and solve this problem using nonlinear programming after discretization of the problem. Since it takes longer to solve the problem with such an approach, we then provide a graph-based approximate solution that runs fast. Numerical results show that the proposed approximate solution provides close to optimal results and performs better than state-of-the-art solutions that consider each UAV separately without collaboration among UAVs. © 2021 IEEE.","cellular network; trajectory optimization; UAV","Aerodynamics; Antennas; Graphic methods; Nonlinear programming; Trajectories; Approximate solution; Cellular network; Mission completion; Numerical results; Optimal results; Partial coverage; State of the art; Trajectory optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15502252","978-172818964-2","IVTCD","","English","IEEE Veh Technol Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111746704"

Moreover, rapid development of the technology allows us to increase the automation rate, making the human operator generally less important within the entire process. This article presents a multirobotic system designed for highly automated radiation mapping and source localization. Our approach includes a three-phase procedure comprising sequential deployment of two diverse platforms, namely, an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), to perform aerial photogrammetry, aerial radiation mapping, and terrestrial radiation mapping. The central idea is to produce a sparse dose rate map of the entire study site via the UAS and, subsequently, to perform detailed UGV-based mapping in limited radiation-contaminated regions. To accomplish these tasks, we designed numerous methods and data processing algorithms to facilitate, for example, digital elevation model-based terrain following for the UAS, automatic selection of the regions of interest, obstacle map-based UGV trajectory planning, and source localization. The overall usability of the multirobotic system was demonstrated by means of a 1-day, authentic experiment, namely, a fictitious car accident including the loss of several radiation sources. The ability of the system to localize radiation hotspots and individual sources has been verified. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","aerial robotics; cooperative robots; environmental monitoring; radiation mapping; terrestrial robotics","Agricultural robots; Aircraft accidents; Antennas; Data handling; End effectors; Health risks; Infrared radiation; Mapping; Photogrammetry; Radiation; Robotics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial photogrammetry; Data processing algorithms; Digital elevation model; Multi-robotic systems; Source localization; Terrestrial radiation; Unmanned aircraft system; Unmanned ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","P.

Secondly, the attractive potential field function and the repulsive potential field function containing the distance term are defined, and the potential field function between the UAVs considering the influence of communication is designed to realize the control objectives of UAV collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and smoothly reaching the target point. Then, a new consensus control protocol is designed by combining IAPF and consensus theory. UAVs can achieve convergence and consensus of relative distance and speed between the UAVs while maintaining the stability of the formation. Finally, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the stability of the system, and simulations are carried out through the formation of four UAVs. The results show that this method can achieve the control objectives of collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and the convergence of position and speed in the formation of trajectory planning. © 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","communication influence; consensus protocol; Cooperative formation; distributed control; improved artificial potential field","Antennas; Collision avoidance; Cooperative communication; Distributed parameter control systems; System stability; Trajectories; Artificial potential fields; Communication influence; Consensus protocols; Cooperative formation; Distributed-control; Field function; Field theory; Improved artificial potential field; Potential field; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","Peng C.; Sun J.","IEEE Computer Society","19341768","978-988156380-4","","","English","Chinese Control Conf., CCC","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117319005"

In this paper, we design an optimized multi-UAV cooperative path planning method under the complex confrontation environment. Firstly, the threat model is designed based on the actual situation. Combining the threat and fuel consumption criteria, under the constraints of time and space, a multi-constraint objective optimization model is established. Following this, an improved grey wolf optimizer algorithm is used to solve the optimization model. Based on the characteristics of the multi-UAV cooperative path planning, the algorithm is improved in three aspects: population initialization, decay factor updating, and individual position updating. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in generating paths for multi-UAV cooperative path planning and has the advantages of a lower path cost and faster convergence speed as compared to the other algorithms tested in this work. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","GWO; Multi-UAV; Path planning; Threat model","Constrained optimization; Military applications; Remote sensing; Civil applications; Cooperative path planning; Emerging technologies; Faster convergence; Objective optimization; Optimization modeling; Population initializations; Position updating; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","C.

Modern military vehicles are typically equipped with electro-optical sensor systems for such observation or surveillance purposes. However, especially when the line-of-sight to the onward route is obscured or visibility conditions are generally limited, more enhanced methods for reconnaissance are needed. The obvious benefit of micro-drones (UAVs) for remote reconnaissance is well known. The spatial mobility of UAVs can provide additional information that cannot be obtained on the vehicle itself. For example, the UAV could keep a fixed position in front and above the vehicle to gather information about the area ahead, or it could fly above or around obstacles to clear hidden areas. In a military context, this is usually referred to as manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T). In this paper, we propose the use of vehicle-based electro-optical sensors as an alternative way for automatic control of (cooperative) UAVs in the vehicle's vicinity. In its most automated form, the external control of the UAV only requires a 3D nominal position relative to the vehicle or in absolute geocoordinates. The flight path there and the maintaining of this position including obstacle avoidance are automatically calculated on-board the vehicle and permanently communicated to the UAV as control commands. We show first results of an implementation of this approach using 360° scanning LiDAR sensors mounted on a mobile sensor unit. The control loop of detection, tracking and guidance of a cooperative UAV in the local environment is demonstrated by two experiments. We show the automatic LiDAR-controlled navigation of a UAV from a starting point A to a destination point B. with and without an obstacle between A and B. The obstacle in the direct path is detected and an alternative flight route is calculated and used.  © 2021 SPIE.","3D path planning; Flying object detection; Remote reconnaissance; UAV detection; UAV tracking","Automation; Automobile drivers; Autonomous vehicles; Military vehicles; Motion planning; Object detection; Optical radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 3D path planning; Civilian vehicles; Driver assistance; Electrooptical sensors; Flying object detection; Line of Sight; Localisation; Remote reconnaissance; Road traffic; Sensor systems; Aircraft detection","M.

In particular, a two-stage framework is proposed. In the first phase, UAVs first localize the ground nodes using received signal strength measurements. Next, the UAVs transition to acting as relays between the ground nodes once their locations have been determined, within a certain level of tolerance. In the first stage, the UAVs assigned to the search task cooperatively plan their trajectories in order to maximize the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix for all of the ground nodes. In the second stage, the UAVs assigned to the relay task cooperatively plan their trajectories in order to minimize the cost of the minimum spanning tree of the graph that models the overall network. In both stages, the UAVs plan in a distributed manner with a receding horizon approach. A discrete genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal control inputs while considering the collision avoidance and dynamic constraints of the fixed-wing UAVs. The UAVs switch from one task to another when their base station determines that the estimate for a ground node has reached an acceptable level of uncertainty and that the ground node is disconnected from the network. Demonstrations of this framework with a single and multiple targets and UAVs are presented along with analysis of the performance of the trajectory planning in improving estimates of target locations and in improving the connectivity of the ground network. © 2020 IEEE.","","Antennas; Fisher information matrix; Fixed wings; Genetic algorithms; Graph algorithms; Location; Trajectories; Trees (mathematics); Uncertainty analysis; Dynamic constraints; Minimum spanning trees; Multiple targets; Optimal positioning; Overall networks; Received signal strength measurements; Trajectory Planning; Trajectory planning algorithm; Digital avionics","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21557195","978-172819825-5","ADACF","","English","AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097996495"

First, with models of separated regions and heterogeneous UAVs, the objective function and flight constraints are analyzed to fully search the best solutions for the path planning problem. Then, considering a dense target group model, a path planning method based on an Improved Ant Colony System algorithm (IACS) is proposed. The IACS algorithm is able to achieve an efficiency enhancement in time consumption on targets detection and minimize the total time of UAV mission execution by adopting a novel target exploring scheme called BI-directional simplified search strategy in the target selection process.

While initial use by first responders focused on manual operations, the need to improve utilization necessitates higher levels of automation.Contributing towards that end-goal, this work derives swarm path planning algorithms that can effectively and efficiently be employed to search and monitor the operating field. A swarm is composed by two or more units, that coordinate to achieve the mission objectives including minimizing search time while ensuring coverage of the field. A graph theoretic approach is followed to model the underlying swarm path planning problem and mathematical programming is employed to describe a number of important variants of the cooperative strategies that arise. Thereafter, 4 algorithms are derived to solve the swarm path planning problem that are computationally efficient to implement and use in practice. A thorough performance evaluation is conducted to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each heuristic using a number of key performance metrics. © 2020 IEEE.","drone swarms; emergency response; mathematical programming; Path planning","Antennas; Drones; Graph theory; Mathematical programming; Computationally efficient; Cooperative strategy; Emergency response; Graph theoretic approach; Mission objectives; Path planning problems; Path-planning algorithm; Performance metrics; Emergency services","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172814277-7","","","English","International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094967356"

With such a tracking mode, there is a moving laser spot on the target, which will bring trouble for cooperative manned helicopters. In this paper, we propose a new way of tracking, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) circles on one side of the tracked target. A circular path algorithm is developed for monitoring the relative position between the UAV and the target considering the real-time range and the bearing angle. This can determine the center of the new circular path if the predicted range between the UAV and the target does not meet the monitoring requirements. A transition path algorithm is presented for planning the transition path between circular paths that constrain the turning radius of the UAV. The transition path algorithm can generate waypoints that meet the flight ability. In this paper, we analyze the entire method and detail the scope of applications. We formulate an observation angle as an evaluation index. A series of simulations and evaluation index comparisons verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2019 The Authors","Bearing angle; Fixed-wing UAV; Laser designation; Moving target tracking; Path planning","Antennas; Fixed wings; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Automatic tracking; Evaluation index; Moving target tracking; Moving targets; Observation angle; Relative positions; Scope of application; Transition paths; Aircraft detection","R.-M.

The path planning of a single UAV and the orbit of a multi-UAV cooperative formation tracking a moving target are studied. A feedback control is used to ensure heading convergence for the path planning of a single UAV. Moreover, a guidance vector field method is proposed to achieve heading convergence, and it is able to analyze and solve the collision problem between the UAVs. Further, a multiple variables controller is used to maintain the cooperative UAV formation in a circular orbit during flight, and adaptive estimations for unknown wind conditions and moving targets are used to determine the flight stability of the formation in the circular orbit. Simulation results show that a formation of three UAVs rapidly get close to a target with the same attitude and position while remaining relatively stable, and the relative distance error between any two UAVs rapidly converges to the stable value in the case of unknown wind conditions and moving targets.

The ground mobile robot, usually unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), as a carrier, is able to deploy and harvest the aerial flying robots, and each aerial flying robot, usually unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), takes off from and lands on the carrier. At the same time, owing to the limited duration in the air in one flight, UAVs should return to the ground mobile robot timely for its energy-saving and recharge. This work is motivated by cooperative search and reconnaissance missions in the field of heterogeneous robot system. Especially, some targets with given positions are assumed to be visited by any of the UAVs. For the cooperative path planning problem, this paper establishes a mathematical model to solve the path of two UAVs and UGV. Many real constraints including the maximum speed of two UAVs and UGV, the minimum charging time of two UAVs, the maximum hovering time of UAVs, and the dynamic constraints among UAVs and UGV are considered. The objective function is constructed by minimizing the time for completing the whole mission. Finally, the path planning problem of the robot system is transformed into a multi-constrained optimization problem, and then the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to obtain the path planning results.

Aiming at the multi-team collaborative operation mode for plant protection orders in the region, the key factors such as order time window, farmland infection status and multi-machine coordination were comprehensively considered, and a multi-objective scheduling model for UAV plant protection team with the maximum total revenue and the shortest total operation time as the optimization objective was established. The order priority sorting algorithm and the path planning algorithm based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-Ⅱ) were designed to solve the model. A case study of plant protection operations in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province was carried out to illustrate the validity of the proposed model and algorithm. Experiments showed that the model and algorithm designed can output the Pareto optimal solution set satisfying the time window constraint, and can give reasonable transfer path and time arrangement for UAV plant protection team. Moreover, the algorithm had good search performance and stable convergence performance, which can meet the needs of real scheduling problems. At the same time, research showed that increasing the order window time was beneficial to increase the total operating income and reduce the total operation time.

The work finds inspiration in the geocaching outdoor game. It leverages place recognition methods, information sharing and collaborative work between MAVs. It is unique in that a priori none of the MAVs knows the trajectory, waypoints and destination. The MAVs collectively solve a series of problems that involve the recognition of physical places and determination of their GPS coordinates. Our algorithm builds upon various methods that had been created for place recognition. The need for a decisional framework comes from the fact that all methods are fallible and make place recognition errors. In this paper, we augment the navigation algorithm with a decisional framework resolving conflicts resulting from errors made by place recognition methods. The errors divide the members of a swarm with respect to the location of waypoints (i.e., some members continue the trip following the proper itinary; others follow a wrong one). We propose four decisional algorithms to resolve conflicts among members of a swarm due to place recognition errors. The performance of the decisional algorithms is modeled and analyzed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Drone formation control; Drone swarm; Goal location; Information sharing; Localization; Micro aerial vehicle; Navigation; Path planning; Place recognition; Quadcopter","Air navigation; Antennas; Errors; Mobile ad hoc networks; Navigation; Collaborative Work; GPS Coordinates; Information sharing; Micro aerial vehicle; Navigation algorithms; Place recognition; Waypoints; Micro air vehicle (MAV)","J.

In the path planning stage, considering the maneuvering curvature restrictions of UAV turning motion, the Dubins curve is used as the basic substructure of the path. In order to obtain the optimal connection control point of the Dubins curve, a preview distance planning algorithm with adaptive prefollowing path characteristics is designed. In the velocity planning stage, aiming at the control parameterization and time discretization(CPTD) velocity planning method, a differential zone velocity planning method under rasterized airspace is proposed, which is shortened to DIPR. The simulation results show that the preview distance adaptive algorithm can effectively optimize the path.compared with the fixed preview distance method, the turning degree is reduced by an average 30.70%, and the tracking deviation is reduced by 16.41%, the path length is decreased by 10.87%.compared with CPTD method, DIPR converges 30 generation earlier, and the convergence value increases by 10.67% in average.

Firstly, the single UAV path planning model is established. Then the particle diversity and the convergence of path planning algorithm are improved by introducing the Hooke-Jeeves search algorithm for particles with low fitness evaluation function values. The constraint violation function is introduced for particles that do not satisfy the constraint. The new particle evaluation mechanism is proposed to promote the optimal solution of the particle search at the constraint boundary, which accelerates the computational efficiency of the path planning algorithm. The collaborative algorithm is designed to solve the cooperative variable. PSO-HJ algorithm is used to calculate the path parameters of single UAV respectively. Multi-UAV path planning layer coordinated arrival time to calculate simultaneous arrival time. Simulation results show that the accuracy of the PSO-HJ algorithm is 20.85% higher than the accuracy of the Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (QPSO), and 58.14% higher than the accuracy of the PSO algorithm.

In particular, the operation mode of ""launch-recovery-relaunch"" will greatly improve the efficiency of a UAV swarm. However, it is difficult to realize large-scale aerial recovery of UAV swarms because this process involves complex multi-UAV recovery scheduling, path planning, rendezvous, and acquisition problems. In this study, the recovery problem of a UAV swarm by a mother aircraft has been investigated. To solve the problem, a recovery planning framework is proposed to establish the coupling mechanism between the scheduling and path planning of a multi-UAV aerial recovery. A genetic algorithm is employed to realize efficient and precise scheduling. A homotopic path planning approach is proposed to cover the paths with an expected length for long-range aerial recovery missions. Simulations in representative scenarios validate the effectiveness of the recovery planning framework and the proposed methods. It can be concluded that the recovery planning framework can achieve a high performance in dealing with the aerial recovery problem. © 2020 by the authors.","Aerial recovery; Genetic algorithm; Homotopic approach; Mother aircraft; Recovery planning framework; UAV swarm","","N.

This paper focuses on a search- and-track (SAT) mission for an underwater target, and the mission is implemented by combining an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In the cooperative path planning model, the mission is divided into the search phase and the track phase, and the goals of the two phases are to maximize the search space and minimize the terminal error respectively. The constraints contain the maneuverability of vehicles and communication ranges between vehicles. Strategies based on random simulation experiments and asynchronous planning are developed to design the cooperative path planning algorithm in the two phases, and the paths are generated by an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm in a centralized or a distributed mode. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can deal with different situations.

Areas of study to date have included the broadly applied concepts of environment perception and modeling, autonomous cooperation, collaborative position control, and path planning. Multiple opportunities are emerging for the technology to be advantageous in agriculture. An example includes using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for remote sensing in cooperation with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that will perform ground-based activities in accord with analysis of the remote-sensing data. This case could be applied in mapping and mitigation of insects and weeds as well as harvesting according to variations in crop yield and maturity. Another example includes using a UGV to serve as an autonomous ground-control point in order to maximize the accuracy of UAV remote-sensing data.

In this paper, we investigate a throughput oriented, real-time path planning method for the high-altitude Solar-Powered UAV (SP-UAV) to ensure high quality communication of long-range mission UAVs. Firstly, based on the spatial distribution, the Channel State Information (CSI) and the potential field theory, we design the channel-aware-aided relay SP-UAV which is capable of adaptively changing its position, while maximizing the total throughput of the communication system. Secondly, in the feedback loop design, a cooperative game theory model is introduced to formulate a feedback-aided strategy for adjusting the weighting factors, which can further improve the whole communication performance. Specifically, to ensure the real-time performance, a low complexity algorithm and the real-time updated system conditions are applied in calculating the planning trajectory of the relay UAV. Simulation results show that compared with the relay UAV with a fixed cruise trajectory, our proposed scheme achieves better network throughput and has good tracking adaptability.  © 2013 IEEE.","Adaptive trajectory planning; channel-aware potential field; cooperative game theory; relay communication; solar-powered UAV","Aircraft detection; Channel state information; Computational complexity; Game theory; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Communication performance; Communication support; Cooperative game theory; Development potential; Feedback loop design; Low complexity algorithm; Real time path planning; Real time performance; Cooperative communication","Y.

This article presents the design of a novel ground-based electric vehicle used as a technology demonstrator for autonomous multi-drone systems. The vehicle is equipped with differential steering, battery management circuits, optical and vector flow encoders, omni-vision and wireless transceivers. The vehicle is based on an 8-bit microcontroller (MCU) which is remotely controlled via a computer. The MCU is also responsible with the sensor acquisition, telemetry and message display for local debugging. The final goal of the system is to develop a testbed for path planning and coordination of agents in a swarm system based on simple cooperative and competitive algorithms.

Although it is popular and easy to accomplish, positioning based on trilateration method still faces challenges under scenarios with multiple UAVs. First, large accumulated errors will be brought if a single UAV is used to perform trilateration on same targets. Second, due to the mobility of targets, the time interval between UAVs performing twice successive distance measurement on one target cannot be long for positioning precision. Finally, the limited energy provided by onboard battery limits the time for UAVs to perform tasks. Once the energy used by some of the UAVs reaches limitation, the whole positioning mission will fail. Thus, to complete the mission of locating multiple targets, this paper is intended to minimize the maximum energy consumption among all UAVs. We formulate the problem, and decompose it into two subproblems, one of which plans the routes for UAV groups and the other plans the routes for UAVs in a group. To solve the first subproblem, a heuristic algorithm called adjusted genetic algorithm (AGA) is proposed to plan trajectories for all UAV groups under constraints on maximum energy consumption. To guarantee stable performance and reduce computation complexity, we propose an approximation algorithm, Tree Decomposition united with Christofides Algorithm (TDCA), and the approximation ratio is proved to be (3∗N′/(2∗(N′-1))), where N′ denotes the number of UAV groups. For the second subproblem, a two-step greedy heuristic algorithm is proposed to plan trajectories for UAVs in same groups. Extensive simulations show that compared to existing algorithms, the proposed algorithms can reduce up to 26.6% maximum and 26.3% average energy consumption. © 2013 IEEE.","approximation algorithm; Christofides algorithm; cooperative UAVs; energy consumption; Trajectory planning; tree decomposition","Antennas; Energy utilization; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Surveying; Trajectories; Trees (mathematics); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Accumulated errors; Approximation ratios; Computation complexity; Extensive simulations; Multi-target positioning; Positioning precision; Trajectory Planning; Tree decomposition; Approximation algorithms","C.

First, on the basis of three-dimensio- nal planning space, the cost function model of multi-UAV cooperation is established in accordance with the requirement of path planning. Moreover, an initial track set is con- structed by combining with the multi-population concept. Second, given that the GWO algorithm is easy to fall into a local optimum, a chaotic search strategy is adopted to improve this algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm is used to solve the path plan- ning problem of obtaining multiple cooperative paths. Simulation result shows that this algorithm can satisfy the constraints related to path planning and realize multi-UAV co- operative path planning. In comparison with GWO, EA, and PSO algorithms, stability and search accuracy are improved through the proposed algorithm. © 2020, ICIC International.","Chaotic local search; Gray wolf optimization; Multi-UAV cooperation; Multipopulation; Path planning","Cost functions; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Chaotic search strategies; Cooperative path planning; Cooperative tasks; Multi population; Path planning method; Path planning problems; PSO algorithms; Search accuracy; Motion planning","","","ICIC International","13494198","","","","English","Int.

In the near future, more and more UAS applications will be facilitated by the cooperation of multiple UAVs. In such applications, it is desirable to utilize a general control platform for cooperative UAVs. However, existing open-source control platforms cannot fulfill such a demand because (1) they only support the leader-follower mode, which limits the design options for fleet control, (2) existing platforms can support only certain type of UAVs and thus lack compatibility, and (3) these platforms cannot accurately simulate a flight mission, which may cause a big gap between simulation and real-world flight. To address these issues, we propose a general control and monitoring platform for cooperative UAS, namely, CoUAS, which provides a set of core cooperation services of UAVs, including synchronization, connectivity management, path planning, energy simulation, and so on. To verify the applicability of CoUAS, we design and develop a prototype in which an embedded path planning service is provided to complete any task with the minimum flying time while considering the network connectivity and coverage. Experimental results by both simulation and field test demonstrate that the proposed system is viable. © 2020 ACM.","cooperation; open-source; path planning; simulation; testbed; UAV fleet","Antennas; Flight simulators; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Connectivity management; Control and monitoring; Control platform; Energy simulation; Flight mission; Leader-follower modes; Network connectivity; Unmanned aircraft system; Simulation platform","Z.

Search and Rescue (SAR) is one of the most prominent areas for the employment of UAVs in place of a manned mission, especially because of its limitations on the costs, human resources, and mental and perception of the human operators. In this work, a real-time path-planning solution using multiple cooperative UAVs for SAR missions is proposed. The technique of Particle Swarm Optimization is used to solve a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem that aims to perform search in a given area of interest, following the directive of international standards of SAR. A coordinated turn kinematic model for level flight in the presence of wind is included in the MPC. The solution is fully implemented to be embedded in the UAV on-board computer with DUNE, an on-board navigation software. The performance is evaluated using Ardupilot's Software-In-The-Loop with JSBSim flight dynamics model simulations. Results show that, when employing three UAVs, the group reaches 50% Probability of Success 2.35 times faster than when a single UAV is employed.","Ardupilot; DUNE; JSBSim; model predictive control; particle swarm optimization; path planning; search and rescue; software in the loop; UAV; unmanned aerial vehicles","article; human; human experiment; model predictive control; particle swarm optimization; probability; simulation; software; standard","","","NLM (Medline)","14248220","","","31547143","English","Sensors (Basel)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072573732"

Results of recent research works on trajectory planning reveal persisting theoretical and practical problems. To mitigate them, this paper proposes a novel optimized artificial potential field algorithm for multi-unmanned aerial vehicle operations in a three-dimensional dynamic space. For all purposes, this study considers the unmanned aerial vehicles and obstacles as spheres and cylinders with negative electricity, respectively, while the targets are considered spheres with positive electricity. However, the conventional artificial potential field algorithm is restricted to a single unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory planning in two-dimensional space and usually fails to ensure collision avoidance. To deal with this challenge, we propose a method with a distance factor and jump strategy to resolve common problems such as unreachable targets and ensure that the unmanned aerial vehicle does not collide into the obstacles. The method takes companion unmanned aerial vehicles as the dynamic obstacles to realize collaborative trajectory planning.

The system can complete a series of complex tasks and one of them is pursuit-evasion decision, so a collaborative strategy of UAV/UGV heterogeneous system is proposed to derive a pursuit-evasion game in complex three-dimensional (3D) polygonal environment, which is large enough but with boundary. Firstly, the system and task hypothesis are introduced. Then, an improved boundary value problem (BVP) is used to unify the terrain data of decision and path planning. Under the condition that the evader knows the position of collaborative pursuers at any time but pursuers just have a line-of-sight view, a worst case is analyzed and the strategy between the evader and pursuers is studied. According to the state of evader, the strategy of collaborative pursuers is discussed in three situations: evader is in the visual field of pursuers, evader just disappears from the visual field of pursuers, and the position of evader is completely unknown to pursuers. The simulation results show that the strategy does not guarantee that the pursuers will win the game in complex 3D polygonal environment, but it is optimal in the worst case.  © 2020 Xiao Liang et al.","","Antennas; Boundary value problems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Vision; Collaborative strategies; Heterogeneous systems; Polygonal environment; Pursuit evasion; Pursuit evasion games; Threedimensional (3-d); UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle); Unmanned ground vehicles; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Hindawi Limited","10762787","","","","English","Complexity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089309376"

Although, in literature, a lot of research proposals exist on the path planning problems of UAVs but still issues of target location and identification persist keeping in view of the high mobility of UAVs. To solve these issues in UAVs path planning, optimal decisions need to be taken for various mission-critical operations performed by UAVs. These decisions require a map or graph of the mission environment so that UAVs are aware of their locations with respect to the map or graph. Keeping focus on the aforementioned points, this paper analyzes various UAVs path planning techniques used over the past many years. The aim of path planning techniques is not only to find an optimal and shortest path but also to provide the collision-free environment to the UAVs. It is important to have path planning techniques to compute a safe path in the shortest possible time to the final destination. In this paper, various path planning techniques for UAVs are classified into three broad categories, i.e., representative techniques, cooperative techniques, and non-cooperative techniques. With these techniques, coverage and connectivity of the UAVs network communication are discussed and analyzed. Based on each category of UAVs path planning, a critical analysis of the existing proposals has also been done. For better understanding, various comparison tables using parameters such as-path length, optimality, completeness, cost-efficiency, time efficiency, energy-efficiency, robustness and collision avoidance are also included in the text. In addition, a number of open research problems based on UAVs path planning and UAVs network communication are explored to provide deep insights to the readers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Coverage and connectivity; Path planning techniques; Security; Space-air-ground integrated networks; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications","Antennas; Energy efficiency; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cooperative techniques; Coverage and connectivity; Integrated networks; Mission-critical operations; Network communications; Path planning problems; Path planning techniques; Security; Motion planning","N.

The UGVs play the role of mobile actuators, while the UAV serves as a messenger to achieve information sharing among the UGVs. The UAV needs to fly over each UGV periodically to collect the information and then transmit the information to the other UGVs. The path planning problem for the messenger UAV can be modeled as a Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood (DDTSPN). The goal of this problem is to find a shortest path which enables the UAV to access all the UGVs periodically. In the paper, we proposes a solution algorithm for the UAV’s path planning with uncertainty constraints which means the UAV doesn’t know the UGVs’ motion parameters. The algorithm is based on the idea of decoupling: firstly the sequence for the UAV to access the UGVs are determined by the genetic algorithm (GA), and then a reasonable prediction mechanism are proposed to determine the access locations of the UAV to the UGVs’ communication neighborhoods. Then the theoretical analysis of the effectiveness for the UAV’s path planning strategy is emphasized. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is corroborated through computational experiments on several different scale instances. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood (DDTSPN); Genetic Algorithm (GA); Messenger mechanism; Path planning","Antennas; Biomimetics; Computation theory; Fixed wings; Genetic algorithms; Ground vehicles; Motion planning; Traveling salesman problem; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Collaborative systems; Computational experiment; Information sharing; Path planning problems; Planning strategies; Prediction mechanisms; Solution algorithms; Unmanned ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","B.

Model based on Lyapunov present great solutions. However, setting reasonable parameters for the model is usually based on experience. Moreover, UAVs controlled by the models usually converge to destinations slowly. Heuristic planning algorithms are also mainstream approaches to guide UAVs. However, they hardly consider kinetics of UAVs. This paper proposes distributed velocity-aware algorithm and collision avoidance algorithm to serve motion planning of multiple UAVs. The velocity-aware algorithm generates paths with acceleration vectors that converge to the predefined destinations. The collision avoidance algorithm will be triggered to protect UAVs from collisions when path conflicts are predicted. Compared with hierarchical control model and Lyapunov-like control laws, our approach could improve success possibility of mission achievement for UAVs. At the same time, the algorithms help UAVs take shorter paths and less time to move to destinations safely. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","A<sup>∗</sup> algorithm; Motion planning; Multi-UAV coordination; Velocity-aware","Collision avoidance; Heuristic algorithms; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Velocity; Acceleration vectors; Distributed velocity; Heuristic planning; Hierarchical control; Model-based OPC; Multi UAV; Multiple UAVs; Search and rescue; Motion planning","Y.

In this paper, we investigate multi-UAV collaborative data collection system, where multiple UAVs collect data from two-dimensional distributed devices on flying mode or hovering mode. The objective is to minimize UAVs' total flight time while allowing each device to complete data upload successfully with limited energy. To this end, firstly, a cell partition based on Voronoi diagram is used to allocate the collection areas of each UAV. Then, in each associated area, UAV determines the whole trajectory to serve devices. Lastly, given load requirement of ground devices and energy limitation, the optimal data collection mode of each device is decided to minimize flight time of each UAV. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-UAV data collection scheme can shorten collection task completion time significantly. © 2020 IEEE.","collaborative data collection; Internet of Things; Multi-UAV; path planning","Antennas; Data acquisition; Distributed database systems; Secondary batteries; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Collaborative data collection; Collection areas; Data collection scheme; Distributed devices; Energy limitations; Energy-constrained; Internet of thing (IOT); Task completion time; Internet of things","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15253511","978-172813106-1","","","English","IEEE Wireless Commun.

A cluster of UAVs is of focal interest for its abilities to coordinate along with coverage of large areas, or cooperate to achieve goals such as terrain mapping. Coordination and cooperation in UAV groups also increasingly permit huge numbers of aircrafts to be processed by a single user. Our project aims to develop an algorithm for commanding multiple UAVs to cooperatively perform multiple tasks and to assign specific tasks to each vehicle without collision, congestion, and overlapping by exact localizing each drone. We are proposing the real-time algorithm that works possibly under communications, constraints, and other uncertainties and failures. For the simulation of our algorithm, we use DroneKit, ArduPilot, Pixhawk, and microair vehicle link protocols.

It is necessary for different UAVs to cooperate with each other for servicing many users, and how to determine their cooperative path planning to best meet many users' spatio-temporally distributed demands is an important question. This paper is the first to design and analyze cooperative path-planning algorithms of a UAV swarm for optimally servicing many spatial locations with dynamic user arrivals and waiting deadlines in the time horizon. For each UAV, it needs to decide whether to wait at the current location or chase a newly released demand in another location, under upper coordination with the other UAVs in the swarm. For each UAV's routing problem even without coordinating with the rest UAVs, it follows dynamic programming structure and is difficult to solve directly given many user demands. We manage to simplify and propose an optimal algorithm of fast computation time (only polynomial with respect to both the numbers of user locations and user demands) for returning the UAV's optimal path-planning. When a large number |K| of UAVs are coordinating, the dynamic programming simplification becomes intractable. Alternatively, we present an iterative cooperation algorithm with approximation ratio 1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{|k|}\right)^{|K|}) in the worst case, which is proved to obviously outperform the traditional idea of partitioning UAVs to serve different user/location clusters separately. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to show that our algorithm's average performance is close to the optimum. © 2020 IEEE.","Approximation algorithm; Cooperative path planning; Dynamic programming; UAV swarm deployment","Antennas; Clustering algorithms; Dynamic programming; Iterative methods; Location; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Cooperative path planning; Edge computing; High quality; Internet connection; Mobile service; Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm deployment; User demands; User location; Vehicle technology; Approximation algorithms","","","","23340983","","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Glob.

Though a huge amount of research proposals already endured related to path planning, still path planning problems persist keeping high mobility of UAVs. The usage and applications of UAV evolving rapidly in many areas. To solve the issues related to path planning, a certain optimal decision has to be taken for the various task done by UAV. All decision for path planning requires Navigation info. The motive behind path planning is not just a selection of the optimal path but also to get rid of collision during target operation. This is a very critical task to select the shortest path keeping in view that it should be collision-free to reach its final destination. UAVs have been used in civil applications as well. The main use of UAVs in civil applications is to search and rescue, surveillance, agriculture, monitoring, reconnaissance, etc. The path planning techniques are broadly divided into three brackets. i.e. Representative Techniques, Cooperative Techniques, and Non-Cooperative Techniques. These techniques provide a platform to analyze coverage in terms of area covered by UAVs and connectivity with neighboring UAVs. Path planning is the preliminary requirement of UAV for its autonomous function.

The assignment results determine the geometric relations between the UAVs’ goals, which are used as equality constraints for generating trajectories.

We developed the Cluster-Based Hungarian Algorithm (CBHA), in which (1) tasks are grouped such that the number of UAVs is the same as the number of task groups, (2) the original Hungarian algorithm is applied, and (3) an algorithm for travel-salesman-problem (TSP) is applied to perform path planning for individual UAVs. The performance of the proposed CBHA was compared with the Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA) in Monti Carlo simulations, where different numbers of UAVs and tasks were adopted in the scenario of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles traveling through a number of targeting locations.

It is assumed that the UAVs can cooperate by sharing information among themselves. It is also assumed that the area under consideration contains some landmarks with known locations. The NMPC computes the optimal control inputs for the vehicles such that the vehicles cooperate to transit from a source location to a destination while choosing a path that will cover enough landmarks for localization. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to estimate the vehicle positions using only relative bearing measurements.

Quadrotor UAV-slung load system is an underactuated nonlinear system formed by connecting the load and the Quadrotor UAV with a cable. The modeling of full state system is usually based on Euler-Lagrange equation. To make convenience for controller design, equivalent transformations and simplifications of the system model are usually adopted. According to the different simplified models, many control methods, such as PD control, feedback linearization and backstepping, are adopted, and has achieved control objectives like UAV trajectory tracking, load trajectory tracking, UAV formation planning and obstacle avoidance, etc. If there exist unmodeled dynamics or unknown parameters in system model, the controller can be improved by adaptive control method or introducing observer, etc. For the sake of enhancing robustness and flight safety, the controller can be developed based on optimum control theory, and the control performance can be further enhanced by use of input shaper and saturation function, etc. Intelligent control methods have achieved initial results in some complex control problems such as UAV path planning. Cooperative transportation by multiple UAVs is another emerging research subproject. © 2020 Science Press. All rights reserved.","control method; modeling; quadrotor UAV; slung load","","B.

This article studies the energy-efficient cooperative strategy of rechargeable multi-UAVs for providing seamless coverage and long-term information services for IoT nodes. Considering the limited cruising duration of the UAV, multiple rechargeable UAVs are capable of constructing a closed chain for the sake of alternately supporting IoT nodes. Moreover, a joint IoT node assignment and UAV configuration optimization problem is proposed in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the system. Since the proposed problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we divide it into three subproblems, namely, node assignment scheduling, UAV trajectory planning, and transmit power control. By exploiting sequential convex optimization techniques, we reformulate the nonconvex subproblems into three convex optimization problems which can be solved within the polynomial time. A block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving these energy-efficiency oriented subproblems. Finally, the simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2014 IEEE.","Charging scheme; convex optimization; cooperative strategy; Internet of Things (IoT); unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Convex optimization; Energy efficiency; Information services; Iterative methods; Maneuverability; Polynomial approximation; Power control; Quality of service; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Block coordinate descents; Charging scheme; Configuration optimization; Convex optimization problems; Convex optimization techniques; Cooperative strategy; Internet of Things (IOT); Transmit power control; Internet of things","H.

However, due to the lack of continuous connections between the UAV swarm and ground base stations (BSs), using centralized ML will be challenging, particularly when dealing with a large volume of data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to implement distributed federated learning (FL) algorithms within a UAV swarm that consists of a leading UAV and several following UAVs. Each following UAV trains a local FL model based on its collected data and then sends this trained local model to the leading UAV who will aggregate the received models, generate a global FL model, and transmit it to followers over the intra-swarm network. To identify how wireless factors, like fading, transmission delay, and UAV antenna angle deviations resulting from wind and mechanical vibrations, impact the performance of FL, a rigorous convergence analysis for FL is performed. Then, a joint power allocation and scheduling design is proposed to optimize the convergence rate of FL while taking into account the energy consumption during convergence and the delay requirement imposed by the swarm's control system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the FL convergence analysis and show that the joint design strategy can reduce the number of communication rounds needed for convergence by as much as 35 compared with the baseline design. © 2020 IEEE.","","Antennas; Energy utilization; Scheduling; Vibration analysis; Baseline design; Communication rounds; Convergence analysis; Convergence rates; Cooperative targets; Ground base stations; Trajectory Planning; Transmission delays; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15503607","978-172815089-5","","","English","IEEE Int Conf Commun","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089437520"

In the process of two-UAV cooperative target locating, the performance of target locating is highly dependent on UAV trajectory. In this Letter, a trajectory planning method for two-UAV cooperative target locating is presented. Using the line-of-sight (LOS) targeting property of the airborne visual tracking platform, in combination with the azimuth angle and elevation angle of the measured LOS, a locating error model is established, which can reflect the correlation between the target locating error and LOS angle error. Then an objective function based on minimising the target locating error is built, which is used as an index of two-UAV trajectory planning. This method can be applied in two-UAV trajectory planning for cooperative target locating and the simulated results confirm that it works effectively. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.","","Antennas; Errors; Location; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Azimuth angles; Cooperative targets; Elevation angle; Objective functions; Simulated results; Trajectory Planning; Trajectory planning method; Visual Tracking; Aircraft detection","C.

Task assignment and path planning for multiple UAVs in the above scenarios are essential for successful mission execution. But, effectively balancing tasks to better excavate the potential of UAVs remains a challenge, as well as efficiently generating feasible solutions from the current one in constrained explosive solution spaces with the increase in the scale of optimization problems. This paper proposes an efficient approach for task assignment and path planning with the objective of balancing the tasks among UAVs and achieving satisfactory temporal resolutions. To be specific, we add virtual nodes according to the number of UAVs to the original model of the vehicle routing problem (VRP), thus make it easier to form a solution suitable for heuristic algorithms. Besides, the concept of the universal distance matrix is proposed to transform the temporal constraints to spatial constraints and simplify the programming model. Then, a Swap-and-Judge Simulated Annealing (SJSA) algorithm is therefore proposed to improve the efficiency of generating feasible neighboring solutions. Extensive experimental and comparative studies on different scenarios demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared with the exact algorithm and meta-heuristic algorithms. The results also inspire us about the characteristics of a population-based algorithm in solving combinatorial discrete optimization problems. © 2020 by the authors.

The velocity obstacle (VO) concept is a popular avoidance algorithm which uses a collision cone to effectively determine if two objects will collide in the near future. The VO method is a reactive algorithm that allows for avoidance of dynamic obstacles. This paper proposes a novel approach, the uncertainty velocity obstacle (UVO) method, to enhance the decentralized VO collision avoidance method by addressing uncertainties in the position and velocity of moving obstacles. A scenario is presented to illustrate the utility of this method for an sUAS encountering other cooperating vehicles. In this scenario the vehicles use global positioning system (GPS) messages to communicate position and velocity between cooperative vehicles. Each vehicle uses these states in a constant-jerk Kalman filter to estimate other vehicles' positions and velocities. Numerical simulations show that UVO enhances a vehicle's ability to avoid collisions when operating in uncertain environments. © 2020 IEEE.","","Air navigation; Collision avoidance; Global positioning system; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Velocity; Autonomous navigation; Cooperating vehicles; Cooperative vehicles; Reactive algorithms; Small unmanned aircrafts; Trajectory Planning; Uncertain environments; Velocity obstacles; Aircraft accidents","","","IEEE Computer Society","1095323X","978-172812734-7","","","English","IEEE Aerosp.

This is important in surveillance scenarios where sensing locations should not only be visited as soon as possible, but the captured data needs to reach the base station in due time, especially if the surveillance area is larger than the communication range. In our approach, multiple UAVs cooperatively transport the data in a store-and-forward fashion along minimum latency paths (MLPs) to guarantee data delivery within a predefined latency bound. Additionally, MLPs specify a lower bound for any latency minimization problem where multiple mobile agents transport data in a store-and-forward fashion. We introduce three variations of a heuristic employing MLPs and compare their performance with an uncooperative approach in a simulation study. The results show that cooperative data transport reduces the information idleness at the base station compared to the uncooperative approach where data is transported individually by the UAVs. © 2016 IEEE.","motion and path planning; Multi-robot systems; search and rescue robots","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Base stations; Location; Mobile agents; Monitoring; Communication range; Latency bounds; Latency constraints; Minimization problems; Minimum information; Multiple mobile agents; Simulation studies; Store and forward; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","J.

The main goal of the task studied in this paper is to minimize the time and energy consumed by the system to complete the assigned tasks. In this paper, a complex multitask problem using the hybrid UAV/UGV system is studied, which is divided into three stages, namely, the stage of finding the optimal locations of the relay stations for the UGV; the stage of solving the path planning problem for the UGV; and the stage of the task assignment for multi-UAVs. Furthermore, an improved integrated method is proposed to deal with the cooperative control problems in these three stages. Firstly, an adaptive clustering method is proposed to determine the locations of the UGV relay stations, and then an improved cuckoo search algorithm is used to find the shortest path for the UGV. Finally, a grouping method is presented to solve the multitask allocation problem of UAVs, based on an improved dynamic programming algorithm. In addition, some simulations are carried out and the results show that the proposed method has better performance when it comes to the time and energy consumption and can effectively guide the hybrid UAV/UGV system to carry out the complex multitasks.  © 2020 Jianjun Ni et al.","","Antennas; Dynamic programming; Energy utilization; Telecommunication repeaters; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Adaptive clustering; Co-operative control; Cuckoo search algorithms; Improved dynamic programming algorithms; Improved integrated method; Multi-task allocation; Path planning problems; Unmanned ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","J.

However, resource allocation, interference management and path planning of UAV ABSs have become a series of challenging problems. In this paper, trajectory design and downlink power control of multi-type UAV ABSs are jointly investigated. In order to meet the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirements of users, each UAV ABS needs to adjust its position and transmission power. We propose a non-cooperative mean-field-type game (MFTG) model to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmission power of UAV ABS based on the interactions among multiple communication links. In order to simplify the problem, we cluster the users in the given area to get the initial deployment of the UAV ABSs. Furthermore, the discrete MFTG problem is solved by the proposed mean field Q (MFQ)-learning algorithm.

One of the main elements, to allow the use of a collaborative and autonomous system of multiple vehicles, is the planning of safe routes, which the movement of different agents is guaranteed through the work area, without colliding with obstacles in the environment. Consequently, in this document, multiple path planning is proposed for a Multi-Robot System consisting of several Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; based on the creation of Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM). The objective of this paper is the implementation of a multi-path planning method, for a Multi-Robot system, which must achieve different objectives in a set of proposed situations and the demonstration that the development of Probabilistic Roadmaps constitute an optimal and effective solution for multi-path problem solving. In addition, this solution is integrated in a Robot Operating System (ROS) architecture that provides simple implementation of the algorithms presented in a real fleet of vehicles. Finally, the results obtained show that methods based on PRM create optimal solutions in terms of computing time in swarms of scalable agents and for different situations analyzed, along with the possible integration in a versatile framework such as ROS. © 2019 IEEE.","","Antennas; Autonomous agents; Fleet operations; Industrial robots; Multipurpose robots; Robot learning; Robot programming; Vehicles; Autonomous systems; Computing time; Effective solution; Fleet of vehicles; Multi-robot systems; Optimal solutions; Probabilistic road maps; Robot operating systems (ROS); Motion planning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172813473-4","","","English","IEEE Int.

In scenarios where denial is potentially hostile, the use of stealth approaches is essential, as it allows such missions to be conducted in the proximity of threatening radars and weapons. We propose a model that allows autonomous UAVs to dynamically and cooperatively reduce their exposure to threats by adopting a stealth policy, in which they turn off their communication radios once a threat is detected. We named this approach of cooperative model as Stealth UAV Networks (SUN). Our model also encompasses control laws for connectivity maintenance, collision avoidance between UAVs, flight path planning, coverage area and robustness to communication failures improvement. We validated the approach with different combinations of control laws, number of UAVs and scenario hostility. The exposure of UAVs to threats decreased by at least 61% and at most 96% when the stealth policy is active, considering all simulation settings. Thus, highlighting that the stealth policy can be successfully used in missions that demand the increase of coverage area rate or robustness to failures. © 2019 IEEE.","","Antennas; Image resolution; Motion planning; Robustness (control systems); Autonomous UAVs; Communication failure; Communication radios; Complex mission; Connectivity maintenance; Cooperative model; Coverage area; Uav networks; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1062922X","978-172814569-3","PICYE","","English","Conf.

The proposed framework uses a ground vehicle and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that travel cooperatively and visit a set of targets while satisfying the communication constraints. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and a branch-and-cut algorithm is developed to solve the problem to optimality. Furthermore, a transformation method and a heuristic are also developed for the problem. The effectiveness of all the algorithms is corroborated through extensive computational experiments on several randomly generated instances. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission involving a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground vehicle, where the vehicles must coordinate their activity in the presence of communication constraints. The combination of a small UAV and a ground vehicle is an ideal platform for such missions, since small UAVs can fly at low altitudes and can avoid obstacles or threats that would be problematic for the ground vehicle alone. This paper addresses the coordinated routing problem involving these two vehicles and presents an algorithm to obtain an optimal solution for this problem, fast heuristics to obtain good feasible solutions, and also a transformation method to transform any instance of this cooperative vehicle routing problem to an instance of the one-in-a-set traveling salesman problem. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Branch-and-cut; communication constraints; cooperative vehicle routing; heuristics; mixed-integer linear program; path planning; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Antennas; Cooperative communication; Ground vehicles; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Motion planning; Routing algorithms; Traveling salesman problem; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle routing; Branch and cut; Communication constraints; Cooperative vehicles; heuristics; Mixed integer linear program; Vehicle to vehicle communications","K.

In the near future, the cooperation of multiple UAVs is expected to play more and more important role in emerging applications. However, existing UAV control platforms are lack of good support for cooperative tasks. For example, they control multiple UAVs in a leader-follower model instead of in a more cooperative way. As a result, research teams have to build their own platforms manually from sketch to implement a specific multi-UAV application. In this paper, to facilitate the development of multi-UAV applications, we propose a general control and monitoring platform for cooperative UAV fleet, namely, CoUAS, which provides a set of cooperative services including synchronization, connectivity management, energy simulation, etc. To evaluate the proposed platform, we then implement a prototype and run a designed path planning algorithm on it.

Search and Rescue (SAR) is one of the most prominent areas for the employment of UAVs in place of a manned mission, especially because of its limitations on the costs, human resources, and mental and perception of the human operators. In this work, a real-time path-planning solution using multiple cooperative UAVs for SAR missions is proposed. The technique of Particle Swarm Optimization is used to solve a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem that aims to perform search in a given area of interest, following the directive of international standards of SAR. A coordinated turn kinematic model for level flight in the presence of wind is included in the MPC. The solution is fully implemented to be embedded in the UAV on-board computer with DUNE, an on-board navigation software. The performance is evaluated using Ardupilot’s Software-In-The-Loop with JSBSim flight dynamics model simulations. Results show that, when employing three UAVs, the group reaches 50% Probability of Success 2.35 times faster than when a single UAV is employed. © 2019 by the authors.

Secondly, trajectory planners of MAV and UAV were designed, where the minimum energy consumption and the shortest time to arrival were selected as optimization objective respectively. Then the model of the two planners was approximated and convexified, with the spatial-temporal constraints. After that, the convex optimization algorithm was used to solve the problem.

In this paper, we propose a cooperative jamming scheme to secure cognitive radio (CR) networks. In the proposed scheme, the source UAV transmits confidential information to ground users. Because of the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve), the UAV jammer sends friendly interference signals to protect private information. It should be noted that the primary transmission of CR networks cannot be disturbed. Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average secrecy rate under the constraint of primary interference. Since trajectory planning and power control are coupled, we propose the alternative optimization (AO) algorithm. Furthermore, as the sub-problems are non-convex, sequential convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is a good choice, which makes our scheme converge to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. Simulation results show that the joint optimization of power and trajectory of our proposed scheme is effective for improving the systematic secure performance. © 2020 IEEE.","cognitive network; cooperative jamming; joint power and trajectory planning; physical layer safety; UAV","Antennas; Approximation algorithms; Cognitive radio; Cooperative communication; Jamming; Power control; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cognitive communications; Cognitive radio network; Confidential information; Convex approximation; Optimization problems; Primary transmission; Private information; Wireless communications; Network security","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172817327-6","","","English","IEEE/CIC Int.

In order to ensure the long-term freshness requirements of situation awareness, a swarm of UAVs need to fly frequently among different sensing regions. However, nonstop flying and data processing may quickly drain the batteries armed in UAVs, hence an energy-efficient algorithm for UAVs' dynamic trajectory planning as well as proper data offloading decision is highly desirable. To better model the problem, we propose a freshness function based on the concept of Age-of-Information to express the freshness of situation awareness.

However, search space is very large and search targets are distributed sparsely, and making mission planning and route planning simultaneously is also an NP (Non-Deterministic Polynomial Problems) problem, which makes it extremely difficult in mission planning. Recently, meta-heuristic search algorithms widely used in multi-UAVs collaborative mission planning are difficult to find reliable initial solutions and limit the convergence speed. Aiming at this problem, to take plenty of constraints and performance planning targets in multi-UAV cooperative mission planning problems into full consideration. This paper proposes a two-layer mission planning model based on the simulated annealing algorithm and tabu search algorithm, which solves multi-objectives, Multi-aircraft mission planning problems.

Compared with manned aerial vehicles, they have great advantages in performing dangerous tasks but, presently, no UAV system can cope with high-intensity air combat. In addition, the robustness of a single UAV cannot be guaranteed in air combat missions; on the other hand, a multi-UAV system not only ensures this robustness but also improves the mission success rate by using saturation attacks. Therefore, this paper presents a multi-UAV air combat system based on swarm intelligence. Considering the problem of multi-UAV cooperative arrival at the air battlefield and the accomplishment of combat tasks, the aerodynamic model of the aircrafts and the threat area on the path to the battlefield are modeled; the path planning is completed through an ant colony algorithm. Based on the control algorithm of single-UAV finite-state machine and the cooperation of multiple UAVs, an autonomous control algorithm for multi-UAV systems is proposed to improve the success rate of UAV clusters in air combat.

We decide which robot takes the selected measurements through a bidding framework where each robot computes its predicted cost. Finally, based on a novel continuous trajectory optimization method, these additional measurements collected by the winning robot are sent to the requesting robot to strengthen its pose graph.

The goal of this problem is to find a shortest path which enables the UAV to access all UGVs periodically. This paper proposes an online path planning method based on heuristic rules. The method can be divided into two stages: firstly, the sequence for the UAV to access the UGVs are determined by the heuristic rules which consider the relative positions and movement characteristics of the UGVs and the UAV, and then the access positions of the UAV are determined.

How to realize the cooperative path planning of multi-UAV is an open issue. In order to solve the search performance degradation as dimension increases, a strategy of multi-UAV cooperative path planning based on Cooperative Coevolution Particle Swarm Optimization (CCPSO) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the initial Dubins path is generated for each UAV in the formation, of which the longest one is selected as the reference path. Intermediate waypoints are designed to modify the initial paths to avoid collisions with obstacles. Then, CCPSO algorithm is applied to optimize path parameters and adjust the path length to be equal to the reference path to ensure time coordination. Collision avoidance between UAVs is achieved in the collaborative evaluation phase. Finally, an formation rendezvous example and comparison with CCGA are given to explain the validity and excellent search ability of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.","CCPSO; Collision Avoidance; Cooperative Path Planning; Dubins Path","Collision avoidance; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); CCPSO; Collaborative evaluation; Combat effectiveness; Cooperative co-evolution; Cooperative path planning; Dubins Path; Formation flying; Search performance; Motion planning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172813792-6","","","English","Proc.

Cooperative path-planning for multi-UAV formation rendezvous is mostly a complicated multi-objective optimization problem with many coupled constraints. In order to satisfy the kinematic constraints, i.e., the maximum curvature constraint and the requirement of continuous curvature of the UAV path, the Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curve is adopted as the parameterized path because of its curvature continuity and rational intrinsic properties. Inspired by the co-evolutionary theory, a distributed cooperative particle swarm optimization (DCPSO) algorithm with an elite keeping strategy is proposed to generate a flyable and safe path for each UAV. This proposed algorithm can meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and the cooperation requirements among UAVs. Meanwhile, the optimal or sub-optimal paths can be obtained. Finally, numerical simulations in 2-D and 3-D environments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and stability of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the paths generated by the proposed DCPSO can not only meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and safety requirements, but also achieve the simultaneous arrival and collision avoidance between UAVs for formation rendezvous. Compared with the cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA), the proposed DCPSO has better stability and a higher searching success rate. © 2019 by the authors.","Cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (CCGA); Cooperative particle swarm optimization (CPSO); Distributed algorithms; Formation rendezvous; Path-planning; Pythagorean hodograph (PH); Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","","Z.

Intelligent swarm systems are very efficient at solving group-level problems and their capability to accomplish complex missions with no or little human intervention. One of the most challenging problems is operating in environments with surrounding obstacles such as buildings, thus, often obstructing inter-UAV communication. A UAV swarm is required to maintain continuous communication between its members and preserve the stability of its formation while flying towards an ultimate goal. In this paper we propose MSCS, a new cooperative and adaptive scheme for multi-clustered autonomous UAV swarms. This schemes allows several UAVs operating in a swarm formation to coordinate their navigation and path planning operations by using an adaptive multi-clustered leader-follower approach. The swarm members follow a dynamically elected leader based on the UAV with best fit to lead the swarm towards the destination. The coordination of the UAVs is achieved through SBP (Swarm Broadcast Protocol), a single-hop broadcast UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication protocol, which allows swarm members to exchange information about their current location and their local cluster leader. We present a set of performance results, which show that this scheme contributes efficiently at maintaining the swarm formation's stability at acceptable density and disconnection ratio. © 2020 IEEE.","leader-follower; multi-cluster; swarm stability; UAV swarm","Air navigation; Antennas; Military applications; Military vehicles; Mobile computing; Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles; Broadcast protocols; Human intervention; Intelligent swarm; Leader-follower approach; Navigation and path planning; Surrounding obstacles; Swarm technology; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172813129-0","","","English","Int.

However, for large scale areas, such as large forestry and agriculture mapping problems, the single drone is hard to accomplish its mission of mapping in a relatively short time period of 30 to 45 minutes. In addition, in large forestry mapping, camera, communication, and payload settings may further reduce the maximum endurance of drones in the air. With a single drone, the total required mission time to cover all the area is prolonged, not only producing a high cost for a drone service provider but also having more uncertainty. While with multiple drones, or a fleet of drones, it is possible to identify a globally optimized solution to reduce the total required mission time. In this paper, we mainly discuss the strategy of drone fleet deployment for large scale area surveying. Three key parts are analyzed, including a fleet of drones, cooperative coverage path planning, communication and data processing. The associated state-of-the-art solutions are listed and reviewed. In addition, in this paper, the key operational constraints for large scale agriculture and forestry surveying are analyzed. It should be pointed out that, from a comprehensive point of view, a drone fleet deployment for large scale surveying could attract more attention from the commercial drone industry. © 2019 IEEE.","Agriculture and forestry surveying; Cooperative path planning; Drone fleet management","Cooperative communication; Data handling; Drones; Fleet operations; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Mapping; Motion planning; Surveys; Timber; Cooperative path planning; Coverage path planning; Fleet management; Forestry mapping; Monitoring methods; Operational constraints; Optimized solutions; Satellite imaging; Forestry","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153867024-8","","","English","IEEE Intell.

The integration of UAVs with intelligent, ground WSNs, and IoT proved to be a robust and efficient solution for data collection, control, analysis, and decisions in such specialized applications. Key advantages lay in online data collection and relaying to a central monitoring point, while effectively managing network load and latency through optimized UAV trajectories and in situ data processing. Two important aspects of the collaboration were considered: designing the UAV trajectories for efficient data collection and implementing effective data processing algorithms (consensus and symbolic aggregate approximation) at the network level for the transmission of the relevant data. The experiments were carried out at a Romanian research institute where different crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate that the collaborative UAV–WSN–IoT approach increases the performances in both precision agriculture and ecological agriculture. © 2020 by the authors.

UAVs can fly in high altitude and collect marine environment information on patrolling. Furthermore, UAVs can plan defense paths for USVs to intercept intruders with full-assignment or reassignment strategies aiming at maximum overall benefits. Thus, we propose dynamic overlay reconnaissance algorithm based on genetic idea (GI-DORA) to solve the problem of multi-UAV multi-station reconnaissance. Moreover, we develop continuous particle swarm optimization based on obstacle dimension (OD-CPSO) to optimize defense path of USVs to intercept intruders. In addition, under the designed defense constraints, we propose dispersed particle swarm optimization based on mutation and crossover (MC-DPSO) and real-time batch assignment algorithm (RTBA) in emergency for formulating combat defense mission assignment strategy in different scenarios.

Planning with non-cooperative moving targets often leads to difficulties in utilizing the widely-used path planning algorithms, since their intention and path plans are not known. Furthermore, because a destination of our UAVs path plan can be changed over time, a fast path planning algorithm which can deal with various obstacles is needed. To handle these problems, two key methods are adopted in this work: First, an informative planning is used for predicting each path of enemy UAVs. Second, the iterative linear quadratic regulator algorithm (iLQR) is utilized to derive feasible paths in a mission environment. Utilizing the two methods, the system predicts paths of invading UAVs and allocates friend UAVs to dominate enemies. Finally, each path for an allocated task is computed via iLQR. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Informative planning; Path planning; UAV defense","","H.-L.

The operation distance during one trip of each sprayer-UAV is used as the algorithm optimization variable. Under the condition that the replenishment time of each UAV meets the interval distribution constraint, four factors of replenishment frequency, total replenishment time, total operation time and minimum replenishment interval are comprehensively considered, constituting the objective function.

This paper discusses a cooperative strategy that guarantees bounded navigation error for an UAV flying in poor GNSS coverage conditions ('son'), exploiting the support of a cooperative vehicle ('father') and the available GNSS observables. A customized path planning strategy is developed for the father UAV, which is aimed at minimizing son positioning uncertainty. In view of real time implementation, path planning is complemented by proper cooperative guidance strategies. Planning and guidance approaches are verified in simulations that take into account three-dimensional environment and multi-GNSS constellation coverage. Cooperative navigation potential is demonstrated in experiments carried out flying two quadrotors in formation.

Cooperation consists in enhancing navigation performance of the platform in the challenging area by using another UAV that flies under nominal GNSS coverage and is always in visual line of sight (LOS) with the first. Satellite coverage is estimated with a multi-GNSS constellation approach and challenging areas are defined by setting a threshold for the Dilution of Precision.

This paper addresses the problem of cooperative flight path planning where the air vehicles should arrive at the destinations simultaneously or sequentially with specified time delays, while minimizing the total mission time. This involves finding an optimal assignment of air vehicles to targets and generating trajectories in compliance with the kinematic constraints of the vehicles. The trajectories have to avoid nofly-areas, threats and other obstacles, and must prevent the air vehicles from colliding with each other. The presented algorithm for simultaneous arrival first calculates shortest flight paths between all pairs of air vehicles and targets using a network-based routing model. An optimal assignment and a critical path is found by solving a linear bottleneck assignment problem with costs corresponding to the lengths of the shortest paths. The other flight paths are prolongated to the length of the critical path by automatic insertion of waypoints. This is achieved by concatenating subpaths stored in different shortest-path-trees. Due to the special structure of the network, all concatenated flight paths are flyable and feasible. Sequential arrival at a target is realized by sorting the flight paths according to their lengths and prolongating them whenever necessary to accomplish the desired time delays. The capability of the approach is demonstrated by simulation results. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Cooperative flight path planning; Linear bottleneck assignment problem; Target assignment; Trajectory generation; Unmanned air vehicles","Combinatorial optimization; Graph theory; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Motion planning; Time delay; Timing circuits; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Autonomous air vehicles; Bottleneck assignment problem; Kinematic constraints; Shortest path tree; Target assignments; Timing constraints; Trajectory generation; Unmanned air vehicle (UAVs); Flight paths","L.

Firstly, self-adaptive α-level comparison strategy was proposed to make full use of the feasible and infeasible solution at the different stages of the algorithm. Then, in order to improve the convergence rate and search ing precision for solving constrained optimization problems, the search equations based on opposition-based learning mechanism were designed for the process of virus diffusion in VCS. It was mainly used to improve the population diversity and convergence of the algorithm. Finally, the comparative experiments on thirteen CEC2006 benchmark functions showed that the proposed algorithm possessed more distinct advantages on searching accuracy, convergence rate and stability compared with αSimplex algorithm, particle swarm-assisted genetic algorithm (PSGA), crossover-based artificial bee colony (CBABC) and constrained optimization based on modified differential evolution (COMDE) algorithm.

This paper introduces a new autonomous framework for 3D geometric data collection in a dynamic cluttered environment using an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This method first deploys UAV to collect photo images of a site and builds a point cloud of the 3D terrain of the site, including obstacle information. A mesh grid is then created from the UAV-generated point cloud, and simulation for laser-scan planning is conducted to determine the stationary laser-scan positions at which a mobile robot can collect data with less occluded views while capturing all crucial geometric information. Finally, optimal paths for the UGV to navigate among the estimated scan positions are generated. Promising test results regarding data accuracy and collection time show that the proposed collaborative UAV-UGV approach can significantly reduce human intervention and provide technologies for enabling construction site to be frequently monitored, updated, and analyzed for timely decision-making. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

The UGV, as a carrier, is able to deploy and retrieve the flying robots while each of the latter usually takes off and lands on the carrier. This work is motivated by cooperative search and reconnaissance missions in field of heterogeneous robot system. A sequence of tasks, whose positions are known as prior knowledge, are expected to be accessed by the flying robots in a given order. Owing to their limited duration in the air, the aerial robots, usually unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), should return to the UGV timely and land for its energy-saving and recharge. This paper mainly contributes on the mathematical model for path planning of the special marsupial system. Many real constraints including the maximum velocity of the UAV and the UGV, the maximum hovering time and so on are taken into account in the model. The objective function is constructed by minimizing the time for completing the whole mission. In order to clarify the novel method, a single task point model first is proposed and then extended to multi tasks one. Finally, particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is used to solve the path planning problem. Several simulations verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Air-ground cooperation; Heterogeneous multi-robot system; Marsupial robots; Path planning","Antennas; Energy conservation; Ground vehicles; Motion planning; Multipurpose robots; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Robot programming; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Air grounds; Collaborative application; Heterogeneous multi-robot system; Marsupial robot; Particle swarm optimization method (PSO); Path planning problems; Reconnaissance mission; Unmanned ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","Y.

Our main goal is to reconnect the isolated regions with the outside environment using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by building 3D aerial ad-hoc networks. Prior to network construction, we aim to capture the global map information over region of interests (RoI) by exploring all obstacles in the unknown region. We propose an efficient technique for collaborative 3D terrestrial exploration using multiple UAVs based on our distributed path planning algorithm, which finds collision-free exploration paths. Then, we present an optimal full-coverage 3D aerial ad-hoc network construction by deploying the minimum number of UAVs to indispensable spots while obtaining maximum network coverage.

Nevertheless, constrained by limited battery capacities, the hovering time of UAVs is quite limited, prohibiting them from serving a wide area. To cater with remote sensing applications, people often employ vehicles to transport, launch, and recycle them. The so-called vehicle-drone cooperation (VDC) benefits from both the far driving distance of vehicles and the high mobility of UAVs. Efficient routing and scheduling can greatly reduce time consumption and financial expenses incurred in VDC. However, previous works in vehicle-drone cooperative sensing considered only one drone, thus unable to simultaneously cover multiple targets distributed in an area. Using multiple drones to sense different targets in parallel can significantly promote efficiency and expand service areas. Therefore, we propose a novel problem, referred to as vehicle-assisted multidrone routing and scheduling problem. To tackle the problem, we contribute an efficient algorithm, referred to as vehicle-assisted multi-UAV routing and scheduling algorithm (VURA). In VURA, we maintain and iteratively update a memory containing candidate UAV routes. VURA works by iteratively deriving solutions based on UAV routes picked from the memory. In every iteration, VURA jointly optimizes anchor point selection, path planning, and tour assignment via nested optimization operations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle this novel yet challenging problem. Finally, performance evaluation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm when compared with existing solutions. © 2014 IEEE.","Routing; scheduling; smart environment; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensing; vehicle-drone cooperation (VDC)","Antennas; Drones; Efficiency; Internet of things; Iterative methods; Motion planning; Network security; Optimization; Remote sensing; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Sensors; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Optimization operation; Performance evaluations; Remote sensing applications; Routing; Routing and scheduling; Routing and scheduling algorithms; Smart environment; Target drones","K.

The surpassed pollution levels can be controlled by searching the pollution source. An environmental monitoring unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can address this issue. The challenge here is how UAVs collaboratively navigate towards pollution source under realistic pollution distribution. In this paper, we proposed a novel methodology by using the collaborative intelligence learned from Golden shiners schooling fish. We adopted shiners collective intelligence with the particle swarm optimization (PSO). We used a Gaussian plume model for depicting the pollution distribution. Furthermore, our proposed method incorporates path planning and collision-avoidance for UAV group navigation. For path planning, we simulated obstacle rich 3D environment. The proposed methodology generates collision-free paths successfully. For group navigation of UAVs, the simulated environment includes a Gaussian plume model which considers several atmospheric constraints like temperature, wind speed, etc. The UAVs can successfully reach the pollution source with accuracy using the proposed methodology.

A novel approach of hierarchical fuzzy logic controller (HFLC) and particle swarm optimization is proposed. Initially, teams of UAVs are moving in a pre-determined formation covering a specified area. When one or more targets are detected, the teams send a package of information to the ground station (GS) including the target's degree of threat, degree of importance, and the separating distance between each team and each detected target. First, the ground station assigns the teams to the targets based on the gathered information. HFLC is implemented in the GS to solve the assignment problem ensuring that each team is assigned to a unique target. Then, each team plans its own path by formulating the path planning problem as an optimization problem, while the objective is to minimize the time to reach their destination considering the UAVs dynamic constraints and the collision avoidance between teams. A hybrid approach of control parametrization and time discretization (CPTD) and PSO is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","control parameterization and time discretization; hierarchical fuzzy logic controller; particle swarm optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Aircraft accidents; Combinatorial optimization; Computer circuits; Controllers; Fuzzy logic; Motion planning; Non Newtonian flow; Optimization; Problem solving; Traffic signals; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles; Vehicles; Assignment problems; Control parametrization; Dynamic constraints; Hierarchical fuzzy logic; Optimization problems; Path planning problems; Time discretization; Trajectory Planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-150904494-8","","","English","Int.

A reconnaissance mission has multiple competing requirements, such as short scan time and repetitive scanning of the entire area, target recognition, and target tracking. Especially in real-world military reconnaissance scenarios, different types of targets with hostile characteristics exist. The UAVs must scan and track the targets while avoiding detection by enemies. Although small UAVs are unlikely to be detected, they become prone to detection if their path is predictable. To meet these competitive requirements, we propose an attractive pheromone-based cooperative path planning method that makes path prediction almost impossible by ensuring a random path selection mechanism. To avoid detection during target tracking, we implement a new discrete-time tracking scheme with random time intervals and random path planning for multiple UAVs. The proposed model enables a UAV group to sporadically scan the entire area, quickly locate the targets, and simultaneously track the targets based on their priority. In addition, it offers a mechanism that permits the command and control center to balance between reconnaissance and target tracking operations to meet every mission requirement. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Attractive pheromone; Detection avoidance; Reconnaissance; Target priority; Target tracking; UAVs path planning","Clutter (information theory); Motion planning; Target tracking; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Attractive pheromone; Command and control centers; Competing requirements; Cooperative path planning; Military reconnaissance; Reconnaissance; Reconnaissance operations; Target priority; Aircraft detection","Y.-Z.

Then by reforming the configuration of swarm, UAVs would circle around the target. The assumption in this work is that the arrival time between the UAVs’ final and initial positions are defined a - priori. The constraints in this paper are (i) Three dimensional Dubins path and UAV dynamic constraints, (ii) Minimum separation distance between UAVs, and (iii) Collision-free trajectory throughout the flight.

The coarse exploration makes use of a UGV to carry out fast autonomous exploration and active 2.5D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to generate a coarse environment model, which serves as a navigation reference for subsequent complementary 3-D fine mapping conducted by a UAV.

A cooperative navigation approach is proposed where autonomous flight of a (""son"") UAV in challenging environments is supported by a cooperating (""father"") aircraft flying under good satellite coverage, by means of relative sensing and information broadcast. It is assumed that flight plan for the son UAV does not take navigation issues into account and only depends on mission constraints. Thus, the paper is focused on path planning for the father UAV, and its main purpose is to define a flyable trajectory for the father that allows maximizing the accuracy in son positioning estimation when cooperative measurements are used to overcome the lack of GNSS reliable measurements. The concept of generalized dilution of precision is exploited to this aim. Son and father paths are divided into a discrete number of intervals where relative geometry can be kept constant, and father path is then optimized to provide the requested geometries. Transitions between subsequent intervals are designed taking dynamic constraints into account. Simulation results, obtained integrating Matlab and Robot Operating Systems software environments, demonstrate that proper optimization of father trajectory improves cooperative navigation performance. © 2019 by Xin Ning.

Our goal is to minimize the search time, while gathering more information about the environment and finding more targets. For this purpose, a novel cooperative search and coverage algorithm with controllable revisit mechanism is presented. Firstly, as the representation of the environment, the cognitive maps that included the target probability map (TPM), the uncertain map (UM), and the digital pheromone map (DPM) are constituted. We also design a distributed update and fusion scheme for the cognitive map. This update and fusion scheme can guarantee that each one of the cognitive maps converges to the same one, which reflects the targets’ true existence or absence in each cell of the search region. Secondly, we develop a controllable revisit mechanism based on the DPM. This mechanism can concentrate the UAVs to revisit sub-areas that have a large target probability or high uncertainty. Thirdly, in the frame of distributed receding horizon optimizing, a path planning algorithm for the multi-UAVs cooperative search and coverage is designed. In the path planning algorithm, the movement of the UAVs is restricted by the potential fields to meet the requirements of avoiding collision and maintaining connectivity constraints. Moreover, using the minimum spanning tree (MST) topology optimization strategy, we can obtain a tradeoff between the search coverage enhancement and the connectivity maintenance. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparison simulations by way of analyzing the effects of the controllable revisit mechanism and the connectivity maintenance scheme. The Monte Carlo method is employed to validate the influence of the number of UAVs, the sensing radius, the detection and false alarm probabilities, and the communication range on the proposed algorithm. © 2018 by the authors.

Compared with the traditional problem that all UAVs took off from just one base, this paper is to address reconnaissance missions, which must be done in partnership among multiple UAVs in different bases. To improve missions’ reliability, residence time in effective detection of enemy radars should be mitigated under the premise of missions completed by UAVs. This paper transforms the minimum residence time into the shortest path combinatorial optimization, and discretizes heading angles. Graph theory is applied to analyze path problems and a global model with numerous constraint conditions can be built. Finally, a valuable reconnaissance path planning can be generated through solving the model with genetic algorithm. Also an application example that eight UAVs in four bases finish reconnaissance missions involving sixty-eight targets is established, and then an optimal solution is got to explain both the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed modularization and algorithm. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithm; Multi-base; Path planning; UAV","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Graph theory; Modular construction; Tracking radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Application examples; Battlefield environments; Constraint conditions; Global modeling; Modularizations; Multi-base; Optimal solutions; Reconnaissance mission; Motion planning","W.

However, most studies in multiple UAV control focus on control cooperative path planning in a single swarm, while dynamic deployment of a multiswarm system is neglected. This paper proposes a collective control scheme to drive a multiswarm UAVs system to spread out over a time-sensible environment to provide persistent adaptive sensor coverage in event-related surveillance scenarios. We design the digital turf model to approximate the mixture information of mission requirements and surveillance reward. Moreover, we design a data clustering-based algorithm for the dynamic assignment of UAV swarms, which can promote workload balance, while also allowing real-time response to emergencies. Finally, we evaluate the proposed architecture by means of simulation and find that our method is superior to the conventional control strategy in terms of detection efficiency and subswarm equilibrium degree. © 2019 Tian Jing et al.","","Aircraft; Algorithms; Electronic Data Processing; Environment; Robotics; Workload; Antennas; Clustering algorithms; Computational complexity; Digital storage; Monitoring; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Changing environment; Conventional control; Cooperative path planning; Detection efficiency; Mission requirements; Persistent surveillance; Proposed architectures; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; aircraft; algorithm; environment; information processing; robotics; workload; Adaptive control systems","T.

Collision avoidance and trajectory planning are the core areas of any UAV system. However, there are theoretical and practical problems associated with the existing methods. To manage these problems, this paper presents an optimized artificial potential field (APF) algorithm for multi-UAV operation in 3-D dynamic space. The classic APF algorithm is restricted to single UAV trajectory planning and usually fails to guarantee the avoidance of collisions. To overcome this challenge, a method is proposed with a distance factor and jump strategy to solve common problems, such as unreachable targets, and ensure that the UAV will not collide with any obstacles. The method considers the UAV companions as dynamic obstacles to realize collaborative trajectory planning. Furthermore, the jitter problem is solved using the dynamic step adjustment method. Several resolution scenarios are illustrated. The method has been validated in quantitative test simulation models and satisfactory results were obtained in a simulated urban environment. © 2017 IEEE.","artificial potential field; collision avoidance; jitter problem; Multi-UAV; trajectory planning","Collision avoidance; Jitter; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Artificial potential fields; Multi UAV; Practical problems; Quantitative tests; Trajectory Planning; Unmanned aerial systems; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; Urban environments; Problem solving","J.

These cells are grouped to form larger cells called sub-areas. We use long range and short range communication. The short-range communication within drones in smaller proximity helps avoid re-exploration of cells already explored by companion drones located in the same subarea. The long-range communication helps drones identify next subarea to be targeted based on weighted RNN (Reverse nearest neighbor).

They can act as high-altitude flying relays to support communications between ground nodes due to their ability to provide line-of-sight links. With the flourishing Internet of Things, several types of new applications are emerging. In this paper, we focus on bandwidth hungry and delay-tolerant applications where multiple pairs of transceivers require the support of UAVs to complete their transmissions. To do so, the UAVs have the possibility to employ two different bands namely the typical microwave and the high-rate millimeter wave bands. In this paper, we develop a generic framework to assign UAVs to supported transceivers and optimize their trajectories such that a weighted function of the total service time is minimized. Taking into account both the communication time needed to relay the message and the flying time of the UAVs, a mixed non-linear programming problem aiming at finding the stops at which the UAVs hover to forward the data to the receivers is formulated. An iterative approach is then developed to solve the problem. First, a mixed linear programming problem is optimally solved to determine the path of each available UAV. Then, a hierarchical iterative search is executed to enhance the UAV stops' locations and reduce the service time. The behavior of the UAVs and the benefits of the proposed framework are showcased for selected scenarios. © 2018 IEEE.","3D positioning and path planning; cooperative networks; mmWave communications; unmanned aerial vehicles","Antennas; Cooperative communication; Millimeter waves; Nonlinear programming; Radio transceivers; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; 3D positioning; 3d positioning and path planning; Aerial vehicle; Cooperative networks; Dual Band; Mm-wave Communications; Service time; Trajectory optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Wireless communications; Motion planning","","","","23340983","","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Glob.

Firstly, the factors including line of sight occlusion from buildings, energy consumptions of UAVs and sensors are considered. Correspondingly, the objective functions are designed as target coverage degree, control input cost and sensor energy consumption with switch value respectively, so that the multiple UAV cooperative tracking problem is transformed into a multi-objective optimization problem; Then, based on distributed predictive control, the predictive states of each UAV in a finite horizon are exchanged to build up collision avoidance constraint between UAVs. Combining the minimum turning radius constraints, the distributed cooperative path planning model is formulated. Finally, for the different important levels requirement, all the objectives are fuzzified by fuzzy satisfactory optimization concept. According to the principle that the objective with higher priority will have higher satisfactory degree, preemptive priorities are modeled into the relaxed order of satisfactory degrees. The local preferred path of each UAV is worked out online in a finite period. Comparing with the traditional weighted multi-objective optimization algorithm, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The best path satisfying the requirements of multi-objective optimization and importance levels can be obtained. © 2018, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

The literature contains algorithms focusing on collision avoidance, intelligent task assignment and path planning among UAVs. Cooperative schemes exist in which the UAVs communicate with each other to reach a consensus on how each vehicle will take up one trajectory at a time efficiently based on its capability. In the last decade, much research is being done to use UAVs to track contamination in the environment, detect fires and even volcanic eruptions. As the plumes are constantly varying in space and time, there have to be efficient guidance algorithms for the UAVs in order to keep track of the shape of the plume. In this paper, we survey the literature to explore the currently available trajectory planning algorithms and also the few available plume tracking algorithms. We then formulate the Plume wrapping problem and propose a cooperative trajectory planning approach for a group of UAVs, through which the UAVs communicate their position estimates and planned trajectories to update each others trajectory to efficiently wrap around a plume region so that the contamination in the region can be studied. © 2017 IEEE.","Multi-UAV communication; Plume wrapping; Trajectory planning; UAV","Management science; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Volcanoes; Airborne networks; Cooperative schemes; Guidance algorithm; Multi UAV; Position estimates; Trajectory Planning; Trajectory planning algorithm; Volcanic eruptions; Trajectories","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153863019-8","","","English","IEEE Sarnoff Symp.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040221542"

With the increasing complexity of environment and tasks in surveillance mission,the requirement of UAV swarm reconfiguration and flexibility is also rising. To the adaptive and reconfigurable UAVs swarm, the amount of UAV is one of the basic control factors. However, most studies in UAV swarm control focus on control cooperative path planning in given mission, while dynamic deployment of the UAV amount in swarm system is neglected. In the surveillance design of traditional UAVs swarm, the amount of swarm is hard to adaptively adjust to match the different surveillance environments and various situations. To solve this kind of problem, a ""digital turf"" variation model is proposed on the base of the regional information entropy. Moreover, we imitate a dynamic balancing mechanism in the turf-herbivore ecosystem and design the scale control method in target region-UAV swarm. What's more, on this basis, we study the biomes matrix and equilibrium point situation when surveillance system reaches stable and discusses adaptive adjusting method of UAV swarm in different mission environments with different efficiency constraints. Finally, the existence of equilibrium point and the convergence of system are demonstrated by simulation. © 2018, Science Press.

The path planning of a single UAV and multiple UAV cooperative formation tracking of a moving target is studied. First, the feedback control is used to ensure heading convergence for the path planning of a single UAV. Furthermore, we use a variable airspeed controller to achieve the desired angular spacing and build the information architecture using graph theory for the UAV formation tracking of moving targets. The communication data management module at the cloud stores and transmits to UAV by the ground station. The ground command can maintain a UAV control center which gets access to the cloud for the UAV activity management.

Three UAVs constitute the triangular formation as the control object, where the leader flight path is taken as the expected path and the followers track the leader to maintain the triangle formation flight.

To address this issue, this paper presents a technical solution for building autonomous navigation system based on the concept of Ground-Aerial Vehicle Cooperation. The key features of the solution lie in four aspects: 1) A local reliable self-organizing network is constructed for transmitting control commands and estimated pose information between the UAV and a reusable ground robot; 2) A small and lightweight monocular camera is equipped on the UAV to achieve visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) considering the limitation of UAV's carrying capacity; 3) The modified ORB-SLAM2 system equipped on the ground robot rebuilds a global dense map and reconstructs the 3D environment based on the Octomap; and 4) The low-cost, commercial ground robots and rotor craft were chosen to facilitate other researchers to build a similar platform quickly. Four in-door flight experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the technical solution.

The goal is to reach a set of target points minimizing the travelling distance. Some expected key problems in planetary explorations are the UGVs functionality constraints to reach some target points as a single robot system and the UAVs energy constraints to reach all the target points on its own. We present an approach based on the coordination of a hybrid UGV–UAV system, in which both robots work together for reaching all the target points. Our strategy proposes the UGV as a moving charging station to solve the UAV energy constraint problem, and the UAV as the robotic system in charge of reaching the target points to solve the UGV functionality constraints. To overcome this problem, we formulate a strategy merging combinatorial classic techniques and modern evolutionary approaches aiming to optimize the travelling distance. Our solution has been tested in several simulation runs with different target points distributions. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to generate a coordinated plan for optimizing the hybrid UGV–UAV system in the exploration scenario. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cooperation; Exploration; Heterogeneous robots; Routing","Antennas; Interplanetary spacecraft; Motion planning; Natural resources exploration; Robots; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cooperation; Evolutionary approach; Heterogeneous robots; Path-planning algorithm; Planetary exploration; Routing; Single-robot systems; Unmanned ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","F.

However, the UGV is restricted by its limited perception ability in a cluttered environment. To address this limitation, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can cooperate with the UGV and build out a detailed and complete map. The objectives of this study are to operate aerial and ground robots cooperatively and to fuse point cloud data complementarily. This paper introduces an autonomous cooperation framework using UGV and UAV for 3D geometric data collection in a dynamic cluttered environment. First, UAV is deployed and collects 3D terrain data by using photo images to get an overall idea of the target site. Then, the path planning and stationary scanning locations for UGV are estimated using the gradient-based 3D model generated by UAV. This method was tested on a real-world construction site and obtained promising results. The proposed UAV-UGV cooperative robotic approach is expected to reduce human intervention in data collection and data processing time significantly. Furthermore, it enables frequent monitoring, updating, and analyzing a cluttered environment for timely decision making. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","3D modeling; Antennas; Data acquisition; Data handling; Decision making; Mobile robots; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Autonomous cooperation; Autonomous navigation; Cluttered environments; Cooperative robotics; Environmental mapping; Geometric data collections; Stationary scanning; Unmanned ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","Y.K.

Recently, a Lyapunov guidance vector field approach is proposed to achieve the desired circular trajectory in the paper. The path planning of a single UAV and the Multi-UAVs cooperative formation tracking motion target are simultaneously studied. In the ideal case, a guidance vector field method is proposed for the heading convergence, which has the advantage of analyzing and solving the collision problem between the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Further, a variable airspeed controller is used to maintain the UAV cooperative formation flight in a circular orbit, and an adaptive estimate is introduced to ensure the flight-stability of a circular orbit in the case of unknown wind and moving targets.

Drones are also used in cases where a task can be performed more economically and or more efficiently than if done by humans. These include remote sensing tasks where drones can be required to form coalitions by pooling their resources to meet the service requirements at different locations of interest in a city. During such coalition formation, finding the shortest path from a source to a location of interest is key to efficient service delivery. For fixed-wing UAVs, Dubins curves can be applied to find the shortest flight path. When a UAV flies to a location of interest, the angle or orientation of the UAV upon its arrival is often not important. In such a case, a simplified version of the Dubins curve consisting of two instead of three parts can be used. This paper proposes a novel model for UAV coalition and an algorithm derived from basic geometry that generates a path derived from the original Dubins curve for application in remote sensing missions of fixed-wing UAVs.

Then it finds the track and duration of the entire area with a single drone in the least number of turns;In the local planning stage, the search area is divided according to the initial position and endurance of the group drone.

In these environments, cooperative strategies can be effectively exploited when flying in GNSS-challenging conditions, e.g., natural/urban canyons, while the different UAVs can fly as independent systems in the absence of navigation issues (i.e., open sky conditions). These different flight environments are taken into account at path planning level, obtaining a distributed multi-UAV system that autonomously reconfigures itself based on mission needs. Path planning, formulated as a vehicle routing problem, aims at defining smooth and flyable polynomial trajectories, whose time of flight is estimated to guarantee coexistence of different UAVs at the same challenging area. The algorithm is tested in a simulation environment directly derived from a real-world 3D scenario, for variable number of UAVs and waypoints. Its solution and computational cost are compared with optimal planning methods. Results show that the computational burden is almost unaffected by the number of UAVs, and it is compatible with near real time implementation even for a relatively large number of waypoints. The provided solution takes full advantage from the available flight resources, reducing mission time for a given set of waypoints and for increasing UAV number. © 2018 by the authors.

In this paper, for more efficient computing services, we consider computing tasks offloading in an air-ground system that a ground base station (GBS) and a UAV cooperatively serve the ground users. Our goal is to minimize the total transmission energy consumptions of the ground users by jointly optimizing the multi-user offloading strategy and the UAV's trajectory, while ensuring UAV's mobility and task delay constraints. This problem includes non-convex objective function, binary variables and non-convex constraints. Therefore, we transform the original problem into two tractable sub-problems by introducing the auxiliary variables and relaxing the binary variables. Furthermore, we propose an alternative optimization algorithm to handle these sub-problems. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the total transmission energy consumptions of the ground users. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The problem becomes even more complicated when involving heterogeneous agents, tasks’ minimum requirements and fair allocation. This paper formulates all the combined issues as an optimisation problem and then proposes an integrated framework that addresses the problem in a decentralised fashion. We approximate and decouple the complex original problem into three subproblems (i.e. coalition formation, position allocation and path planning), which are sequentially addressed by three different proposed modules. The coalition formation module based on game theories deals with a max-min problem, the objective of which is to partition the agents into disjoint task-specific teams in a way that balances the agents’ work resources in proportion to the task’s minimum workload requirements. For agents assigned to the same task, given reasonable assumptions, the position allocation subproblem can be efficiently addressed in terms of computational complexity. For the trajectory optimisation, we utilise a Model Predictive Control and Sequential Convex Programming algorithm, which reduces the size of the problem so that the agents can generate collision-free trajectories on a real-time basis. As a proof of concept, we implement the framework into an unmanned aerial vehicle swarm’s cooperative stand-in jamming mission scenario and show its feasibility, fault tolerance and near-optimality based on numerical experiment. © IMechE 2018.","coalition formation; mission planning; path planning; swarm robotics; task allocation; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Aerodynamics; Antennas; Convex optimization; Decision making; Fault tolerance; Model predictive control; Motion planning; Robot programming; Robotics; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Coalition formations; Collision-free trajectory; Integrated decision makings; Mission planning; Sequential convex programming; Swarm robotics; Task allocation; Trajectory optimisation; Swarm intelligence","H.-S.

To ensure the reliability and safety of oil and gas pipeline network operation, it is necessary to inspect the pipeline periodically to minimize the risk of leakage, spill and theft, as well as documenting actual incidents and the effects on the environment. Traditional manpower inspection is extremely labor-intensive and inefficient. Through the use of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) inspection, it is possible to greatly increase efficiencies by reducing the amount of manpower and resources required by traditional inspection methods. The integrated optimization for UAV inspection path of oil and gas pipeline networks, including physical feasibility, performance of mission, cooperation, real-time implementation, three-dimensional (3-D) space, et al, is a strategic problem due to its large-scale and complexity. Aimed at improving inspection efficiency and maximizing economic benefits, this paper proposes a novel mix-integer linear programming model which could be used for inspection path planning. Minimizing the total inspection time is the objective function of this model. The constraints of the mission scenario and the safety performance of UAV are taken into account. By using evolutionary genetic algorithm, each candidate route can be measured through the evaluation function that takes into account the cost of the route, the mission scenario as well as the cooperative and coordinative requirements among the unmanned aerial vehicles constraints. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a virtual oil and gas pipeline network. Compared with the traditional inspection approach, the proposed method is 66.48% less in inspection cost and 22.07% shorter in total inspection time, verifying the rationality and superiority of the model.

Adopting a Visibility Graph (VG) approach, the virtual formation leader plans its flight path composed of circular arcs and segments connecting obstacles vertices. Then groups of obstacles, being not permeable by the flight formation without UAVs separation or formation shape deformation, are clustered and the VG is revised with the addition of so called rendez-vous waypoints, forcing the formation to be recomposed at a given location beyond groups of obstacles. Such rendez-vous waypoints are optimized at a higher hierarchical level with respect to the flight path optimization leading to a Stackelberg game. The validity of the proposed approach and optimization model is shown by means of numerical simulations where flight paths are obtained calculating shortest path on the revised Visibility Graph and waypoints positions are optimized via a genetic algorithm. Finally, anti-collision among UAVs is achieved via a simple potential based method. © 2017 IEEE.","","Aircraft accidents; Collision avoidance; Flight simulators; Genetic algorithms; Graph theory; Motion planning; Optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Visibility; Flight path optimization; Formation flight; Hierarchical level; Optimization modeling; Shape deformation; Stackelberg Games; Two-stage optimization models; Visibility graphs; Flight paths","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-150904494-8","","","English","Int.

Especially, we aim to overcome the challenge of physical obscuration in complex mission environments. To this end, the persistent sensing problem is formulated under an optimal control framework, i.e. deploying and managing UAVs in a way maximising the visibility to the non-cooperative target.The main issue with such a persistent sensing problem is that it generally requires the knowledge of future target positions, which is uncertain. To mitigate this issue, a probabilistic map of the future target position is widely utilised. However, most of the probabilistic models use only limited information of the target. This paper proposes an innovative framework that can make the best use of all available information, not only limited information. For the validation of the feasibility, the performance of the proposed framework is tested in a Manhattan-type controlled urban environment. All the simulation tests use the same framework proposed, but utilise different level of information. The simulation results confirm that the performance of the persistent sensing significantly improves, up to 30%, when incorporating all available target information. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Behaviour recognition; Information-driven tracking; Path planning; Persistent sensing; Target tracking; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Behavioral research; Fixed wings; Motion planning; Target tracking; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Behaviour recognition; Limited information; Moving ground targets; Optimal control frameworks; Persistent sensing; Probabilistic models; Target information; Urban environments; Information use","H.-S.

In this sense, the problem of efficiently building a model of the environment using cooperative mobile robots is critical. Finding routes that are either length or time-optimized is essential for real-world applications of small autonomous robots. This paper addresses the problem of multi-robot area coverage path planning for geophysical surveys. Such surveys have many applications in mineral exploration, geology, archeology, and oceanography, among other fields. We propose a methodology that segments the environment into hexagonal cells and allocates groups of robots to different clusters of non-obstructed cells to acquire data. Cells can be covered by lawnmower, square or centroid patterns with specific configurations to address the constraints of magneto-metric surveys. Several trials were executed in a simulated environment, and a statistical investigation of the results is provided. We also report the results of experiments that were performed with real Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in an outdoor setting.

In the situation of multiple UAVs, the problem is even more challenging due to the tough manipulation of coordination and constrains. In this paper, a novel multi-UAV path planning model is developed which is based on the time stamp segmentation (TSS) technique. Other than the traditional methods, the TSS model utilizes the common time bases to simplify the handling of multi-UAV coordination cost. Then, a novel social-class pigeon-inspired optimization (SCPIO) algorithm is proposed as the solver of optimal search on the TSS model. The social-class strategy is utilized to enhance the convergence capabilities of the standard PIO.

The scenario considers a team of cooperative UAVs, initially docked on moving Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs). In particular, the goal consists in finding the best routing plan for the UAVs in order to visit some designated targets in a wide search area to augment the UGVs’ situational awareness. Taking into account the maximal endurance constraint of the UAVs, this problem becomes equivalent to a time-constrained multiple depot vehicle routing problem with moving depots. To tackle this variant of the well-known vehicle routing problem, a methodology based on a TABU search meta-heuristic is implemented. While respecting the endurance constraint, this methodology tempts to optimize multiple objectives: the number of UAVs required, the total length of the routing and the balance of the lengths of the different routes within the routing plan. The proposed approach based on a meta-heuristic gives relevant results in a relatively short period of time. © 2017","Co-operative UAVs; Multiple-depots vehicle routing problem; path planning; TABU search meta-heuristic; vehicle routing problem with moving depots","Antennas; Ground vehicles; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Motion planning; Tabu search; Vehicle routing; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Inter vehicle communications; Multiple depot; Multiple-objectives; Path-planning algorithm; Situational awareness; Tabu search meta-heuristic; Unmanned ground vehicles; Vehicle Routing Problems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","","","Elsevier B.V.","24058963","","","","English","IFAC-PapersOnLine","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031786770"

For this purpose, a novel decentralized data-driven online control scheme for cooperating vehicles in multi-objective monitoring scenarios is presented in this paper. In the considered use case, multiple UAVs are to adaptively gather measurements for estimating the parameters of an atmospheric dispersion model. At the same time, they are required to cooperatively patrol predefined checkpoints. Vehicle-specific optimal waypoints for each UAV are determined by sequential optimum design. Following these waypoints leads to a maximized information gain of the acquired measurements, such that the parameter estimate is iteratively improved. On the other hand, checkpoint allocation as well as trajectory planning is provided by a decentralized model-predictive controller based on a discrete-time mixed-integer linear problem formulation. By permanent interaction of parameter estimation, waypoint calculation, and cooperative control, a fully optimization-based, yet efficient and adaptive feedback control approach is obtained. Simulations successfully demonstrate its effectiveness. © 2017","actuators; Decentralized; distributed control; Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems; Model predictive control of hybrid systems; Multi-vehicle systems; Networks of sensors","Actuators; Distributed parameter control systems; Hybrid systems; Iterative methods; Model predictive control; Parameter estimation; Vehicles; Adaptive feedback control; Adaptive sampling strategies; Atmospheric dispersion modeling; Decentralized; Distributed control; Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems; Multi-vehicle cooperation; Multi-vehicle systems; Feedback","","","Elsevier B.V.","24058963","","","","English","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044849338"

Two robots are connected with a tether, allowing the UAV to anchor the tether to a structure located at the top of a steep terrain, impossible to reach for UGVs. Thus, enhancing the poor traversability of the UGV by not only providing a wider range of scanning and mapping from the air, but also by allowing the UGV to climb steep terrains with the winding of the tether. In addition, we present an autonomous framework for the collaborative navigation and tether attachment in an unknown environment. The UAV employs visual inertial navigation with 3D voxel mapping and obstacle avoidance planning. The UGV makes use of the voxel map and generates an elevation map to execute path planning based on a traversability analysis. Furthermore, we compared the pros and cons of possible methods for the tether anchoring from multiple points of view. To increase the probability of successful anchoring, we evaluated the anchoring strategy with an experiment.

In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have proved to be beneficial in many applications and services including path planning for autonomous vehicles. Most of the path planning applications assumes the availability of a digital map that allows a vehicle, be it ground or aerial, to navigate through landmarks and obstacles. However, in the scenario of unavailable maps especially during a natural disaster or a in war zone, it becomes extremely handy to have a drone that serves as an eye in the sky that explores the surrounding environment, and generates in real-time a trajectory guiding the vehicles on the ground around obstacles and obstructions. In this research, the UAV, serving as the eye in the sky is equipped with a camera that collects images of the surroundings and assists the ground vehicle in planning its path towards its final destination. Our approach includes the use of a vision-based algorithm which recognizes roads, pathways and obstacles, and calculates a path around them towards the destination. Simultaneously, the UAV keeps track of the ground vehicle progress towards the destination by monitoring and tracking its movement. The generation of the trajectory is based on an enhanced version of the A∗algorithm. The experimental setup includes a robot and a drone, and an ultra-wide band (UWB) indoor positioning system which allows the vehicles to know their current location. © 2018 IEEE.","path planning; tracking; UAV-UGV cooperation; vision-based obstacle detection","Air navigation; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Autonomous vehicles; Collision avoidance; Disasters; Drones; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Obstacle detectors; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Aerial vehicle; Autonomous ground vehicles; Autonomous Vehicles; Eyes in the skies; Obstacles detection; Path discovery; Tracking; Unmanned aerial vehicle-UGV cooperation; Vision based; Vision-based obstacle detection; Motion planning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153866673-9","","","English","Proc.

However, they are unable to meet large-scale and complex missions with a limited energy reserve. Only multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) work together to better cope with this problem and have been extensively studied. In this paper, a new systematic framework is proposed to solve the problem of multi-UAV collaborative task allocation. It is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved by the improved clustering algorithm. The purpose is to enable multi-UAV to complete tasks with lower energy consumption. As the number of UAVs rises, it also appears the flight safety issues such as collisions among the UAVs, an improved multi-UAV collision-resistant method based on the improved artificial potential field is proposed. Besides, the UAVs connected with the internet are vulnerable to the various type of network attacks, a method based on the intrusion detection system is proposed to resist the network attack during multi-UAV mission execution. We have also proposed an improved method to improve the accuracy of task allocation further. In addition, an online real-time path planning is proposed to enhance the robustness of multi-UAV to cope with sudden problems. Finally, the numerical simulations and real physical flying experiments showed that the proposed method could provide a viable solution for multi-UAV task allocation; moreover, compared with other task allocation methods, our method has great performance. © 2013 IEEE.","clustering algorithm; collusion-resistant; intrusion detection system; Multi-UAV; secure communication; task allocation","Antennas; Clustering algorithms; Combinatorial optimization; Computer crime; Energy utilization; Intrusion detection; Motion planning; Numerical methods; Problem solving; Secure communication; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Artificial potential fields; Collusion resistant; Combinatorial optimization problems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi UAV; Online real-time path planning; Systematic framework; Task allocation; Aircraft detection","Z.

One is the improved genetic algorithm (IGA), and the other is the particle-swarm-optimization-based ant colony optimization algorithm (PSO-ACO). As an indispensable part of UAV cooperative mission assignment, the research of UAV path planning has attracted much attention of scholars. In this paper, according to the characteristics of UAV path planning, we firstly establish a corresponding multi-objective multi-constrained combinatorial optimization model- TSP. In the TSP model, the UAV is considered as the travelling salesman, and the mission target is regarded as the travelling city. Then, considering that TSP is a complex NP-hard problem, this paper carries out two optimization algorithms as IGA and PSO-ACO to solve the TSP model, which both can obtain effective and reasonable UAV path planning schemes. IGA is a kind of evolutionary algorithm with implicit parallel ability and global optimization ability. Through the rational selection of encoding mode and fitness function, and valid setting of selection operator, crossover operator and mutation operator, IGA can solve the TSP with great convergence. PSO-ACO is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm with inherently parallel ability and self-organizing ability, which is perfect for solving TSP. Adopting the idea of particle optimization into ant colony optimization algorithm, ants in PSO-ACO system have the particle characteristics that can adjust the local optimal solution and global optimal solution after completing every single traversal. Finally, in the simulation part, based on the stochastic dynamic map, this paper builds the TSP model for UAV path planning. Through the comprehensive analyses of the optimization results of two proposed parallel optimization algorithms and one contrast approach, we can conclude that the proposed IGA and PSO-ACO algorithms are more rational and effective for solving UAV path planning problem compared with the contrast approach. © 2018 Electromagnetics Academy.

Trilateration is popular and easy to implement, but still faces challenges in multi-UAV scenario. First, multiple distance measurements from a single UAV on same targets will lead to large accumulated errors. Second, the time interval between successive distance measurements on the same target cannot be long due to the mobility of the target. Finally, UAVs have limited onboard energy which constrains the flight duration and the mission will fail when some UAVs reach the limitation. In this paper, to complete multi-target positioning mission, we aim at minimizing the maximum energy consumption among all UAVs, which can be decomposed into two subproblems after dividing all UAVs into groups of three. Then we propose a two-stage heuristic algorithm, in which we first use adjusted Genetic Algorithm (GA) to plan the trajectories of all groups with bounded maximum energy consumption and then we pursue to minimize the maximum energy consumption among UAVs in a group. Compared to two other algorithms, extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm can reduce up to 24.9% and 11.8% in terms of maximum and average energy consumption, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","energy consumption; heuristic algorithm; trajectory planning; UAVs","Antennas; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Accumulated errors; Energy trajectory; Extensive simulations; Flight duration; Multi-target positioning; Multiple targets; Trajectory Planning; Two-stage heuristic algorithms; Energy utilization","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15503607","978-153868088-9","","","English","IEEE Int Conf Commun","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070207558"

This paper describes a novel method that utilizes particle swarm optimization to optimize trajectories of the leaders of a multi-quadcopter system (MQS) in a static and known environment. MQS collective motion in Rn (n = 1, 2, 3) is based on a leader-follower paradigm inspired by continuum mechanics. Under this paradigm, the MQS can deform under a homogeneous mapping. This homogeneous transformation in Rn is uniquely defined by the trajectories of n+1 leaders placed at the vertices of a deformable polytope called the leading polytope. With planned leader trajectories, the deformation can be acquired by the followers through local communication with n+1 nearby quadcopters. The proposed hierarchical path planning method consists of global path planning and local trajectory planning for MAS leaders. First, a collision-free roadmap, specifically a generalized Voronoi diagram, is generated. A well-established A* search procedure identifies an optimal route through this map. Waypoints on this optimal path are then passed into a particle swarm optimization (PSO) formulation that generates smooth trajectories for MQS leaders. The proposed method ensures collision avoidance and quadcopter containment. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed method. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In recent years, swarming robots and aircraft have been a subject of much interest; however, many research projects make impractical assumptions such as point mass dynamics with no aerodynamic effects for aircraft models, and most works stop short of fully validating their methods via flight testing. This work presents a proximity based guidance, navigation, and control of multi-agent fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems in an unstructured environment. A scalable swarm navigation method is developed using adaptive moving mesh partial differential equations controlled by the free energy heat flow equation. To emulate the physics-based dynamic characteristics of fixed-wing UASs, mesh nodes are constrained by aircraft six degrees of freedom equations of motion. An optimal control based path planning using virtual points was developed and constrained with aircraft dynamical limitations. Lateral acceleration is used for lateral guidance of aircraft and the aircraft pitch attitude error is used for longitudinal guidance of multi-agent unmanned aerial systems. A decentralized optimal automatic controller was developed to control each system. Using an advanced in-house autopilot system, validation and verification flight tests were successfully conducted using two large unmanned aerial systems with four meter wingspans flying at 35 knots. © 2018 IEEE.","formation flight; multi-agent systems; validation and verification","Aerospace industry; Air navigation; Antennas; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Equations of motion; Fixed wings; Flight dynamics; Free energy; Heating; Mesh generation; Motion planning; Robots; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Automatic controllers; Dynamic characteristics; Formation flight; Guidance , navigation , and controls; Six degrees of freedom; Unmanned aerial systems; Unstructured environments; Validation and verification; Multi agent systems","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153861353-5","","","English","Int.

Nevertheless, it is still challenging to achieve an efficient and fully autonomous vehicle or driving assistance platform due to many strict requirements and complex situations or unknown environments. One of the main remaining challenges is a robust situation awareness in autonomous vehicles when the environment is unknoen. An autonomous system with a poor situation awareness due to low quantity or quality of data may directly or indirectly cause serious consequences. For instance, a person's life might be at risk due to a delay caused by a long or incorrect path planning of an autonomous ambulance. Internet of Everything (IoE) is currently becoming a prominent technology for many applications such as automation. In this paper, we propose an IoE-based architecture consisting of a heterogeneous team of cars and drones for enhancing situational awareness in autonomous cars, especially when dealing with critical cases of natural disasters. In particular, we show how an autonomous car can plan in advance the possible paths to a given destination, and send orders to other vehicles. These, in turn, perform terrain reconnaissance for avoiding obstacles and dealing with difficult situations. Together with a map merging algorithm deployed into the team autonomous vehicles, the proposed architecture can help to save traveling distance and time significantly in case of complex scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.","cooperative mapping; heterogeneous swarms; Internet-of-Everything (IoE); situational awareness; swarm robotics","Disasters; Mapping; Motion planning; Network security; Swarm intelligence; Collaborative mappings; Cooperative mapping; Fully-autonomous vehicles; heterogeneous swarms; Heterogeneous vehicles; Proposed architectures; Situational awareness; Swarm robotics; Autonomous vehicles","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153867713-1","","","English","SAS - IEEE Sensors Appl.

Such a combination of collaborative UAVs is referred to as a swarm. These several platforms enhance the global system capabilities by supporting some form of resilience and by increasing the number and/or the variety of the embedded sensors. Furthermore, several UAVs organized in a swarm can (should the ground control station support this) be considered as a single entity from an operator point-of-view. We aim at using such swarms in complex and unknown environments, and in the long term, allow compact flights.Dynamic path planning computation for each UAV is a major task to perform their mission. To define this path planning, we have implemented a three-dimensional (3D) mobility model for swarms of UAVs using both the Artificial Potential Fields (APF) principle and a global path planning method. In our model, the collaboration between the platforms is made by sharing information about the detected obstacles.

In a given scenario, the heterogeneous vehicles have different capabilities, kinematic constraints, and fuel constraints. Furthermore, the task has other constraints, such as task execution orders, UAV conflict free constraints, etc. This paper presents details of the non-decoupling solution which produces optimal assignment and trajectories for several given scenarios. The performance of the algorithm is compared to that of some previous methods in real-time simulation environment.

The decomposition contains two parts. One is to decompose the multi-UAV cooperative planning problem into successive single UAV planning problems. The other is to decompose the three-dimensional planning problem into horizontal planning and vertical planning problem. A successive planning scheme is employed for generating the UAV paths to alleviate the high computation on the coupled constraints. For each vehicle, the path is generated in the horizontal plane and vertical plane hierarchically to improve the efficiency. In the horizontal plane, a given-range-constrained sparse A* search (GRC-SAS) algorithm is proposed to generate the feasible paths meeting the requirements of time cooperation. And in the vertical plane, an improved altitude-pursuing method is proposed to determine the altitude of each waypoint. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide satisfied paths for multi-UAV cooperation efficiently and is an appealing method for practical engineering. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

One solution to overcome this obstacle is to use a group of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to act as relay nodes, in order to provide a user-defined minimum communication capability. To achieve this, we propose a decentralized cooperative multi-agent system using fixed-wing UAS with nonlinear model predictive control, which aims to guarantee a desired signal strength between the ASV and the ground station.

A novel approach of hierarchical fuzzy logic controller (HFLC) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. Initially, teams of UAVs are moving in a pre-defined formation covering a specified area. When one or more targets are detected, the teams send a package of information to the ground station (GS) including the target's degree of threat, degree of importance, and the separating distance between each team and each detected target. Based on the gathered information, the ground station assigns the teams to the targets. HFLC is implemented in the GS to solve the assignment problem ensuring that each team is assigned to a unique target. Next, each team plans its own path by formulating the path planning problem as an optimization problem. The objective in this case is to minimize the time to reach their destination considering the UAVs dynamic constraints and collision avoidance between teams. A hybrid approach of control parametrization and time discretization (CPTD) and PSO is proposed to solve this optimization problem. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","control parameterization and time discretization; hierarchical fuzzy logic controller; particle swarm optimization; unmanned aerial vehicles; Unmanned systems","Antennas; Combinatorial optimization; Computer circuits; Controllers; Fuzzy logic; Hierarchical systems; Motion planning; Non Newtonian flow; Problem solving; Traffic signals; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Assignment problems; Control parametrization; Dynamic constraints; Hierarchical fuzzy logic; Optimization problems; Path planning problems; Time discretization; Unmanned system; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","World Scientific Publishing Co.

Existing methods either rely on satellite observations, or only rely on UAV observation, did not solve the problem of continuous observation of the maritime moving target. On the basis of analysis of the current methods, we constructed the aerospace collaborative continuous observation model for moving target at sea, and put forward aerospace collaborative continuous observation strategy (ACCOS) to reduce the complexity of solving the model. ACCOS extracted five sub problems to solve the problem: Satellite planning, UAV flight plan, UAV observation sequence, target potential area and distribution probability density prediction, UAV path planning. In order to realize the optimization goal of the model, the five sub problems are modeled and solved in turn. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the average observation period of the target, and effectively solve the problem of the continuous observation of the moving target in the sea. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

However, before UAVs can fly in civilian airspace, they need to be able to navigate safely to their goal while maintaining separation with other manned and unmanned aircraft during the transit. Algorithms for autonomous navigation of UAVs require access to accurate information about the state of the environment in order to perform well. However, this information is often uncertain and dynamically changing. In this paper, a Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) based algorithm is proposed to find the optimal UAV trajectory in presence of moving obstacles, referred to as Intruder Aircraft (IAs), with unknown trajectories. The solution uses an efficient Bayesian formalism with a notion of cell weighting based on Distance Based Value Function (DBVF). The assumption is that the UAV is equipped with the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and is provided with the position of IAs either via the ADS-B or ground-based radar. However, future trajectories of the IAs are unknown to the UAV. The proposed method is verified using simulations performed on multiple scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving the trajectory planning problem of the UAVs. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Bayesian framework; Cooperative flight; Grey wolf optimization; Trajectory planning","Air navigation; Military applications; Military vehicles; Motion planning; Optimization; Trajectories; Automatic dependent surveillance - broadcasts; Autonomous navigation; Bayesian frameworks; Cooperative flight; Trajectory Planning; Uncertain environments; Unmanned air vehicle (UAVs); Unmanned aircrafts; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","M.

NASA said that UAS integration into NAS must be realized without a capacity reduction, a decrease in safety, negative impact in the current operation, or an increase in risk. Especially, UAS Traffic Management (UTM) project is also carrying out because NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recognized the need for a way to safely manage UAS flying at low altitudes in airspace. These projects are expected to operate UAS in the same airspace with many static and dynamic constraints such as other aerial vehicles, bad weather area, and buildings. This paper will describe a pathplaning method with collision avoidance among cooperative aerial vehicles in the same airspace. This path-planning technique in this paper is focused on multi-copter, Omni-directional aerial vehicle, with the latest aerial vehicle trend.

The developed GP filter estimates the UAV states accurately given delayed observation by learning the pattern of network-induced effects on UAV maneuvers.

Due to the influence of the environment and the field, it is difficult to ensure precise source seeking and real-time performance. Existing searching methods use manned machines, robotics or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which are easily affected by the environmental situation and the field. They are also possible to be blocked during the marching journey, resulting in a failure of the task. The rapid development of small unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which includes unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) can solve this problem. In an UAS, UAVs with the installed sensors are able to detect the 3D space in the air, which are barely affected by the ground condition and could communicate with the ground station, and other UAVs via the network. Due to the dangers of the radiative source, it is important to find out the exact location in a short time. Based on the cooperative seeking, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be developed to shorten the process of the source seeking, and estimate the radiative source accurately. Considering the actual situation of the UASs-based cooperative source seeking, this paper presents the models of the UAVs and the radiative source, introduces the fractional order potential field (FOPF) for collision avoidance and path planning, establishes the real-world simulation platform, and utilizes the EKF to effectively localize the accurate position of the radiative source. © 2018 IEEE.","Cooperative; Extended Kalman Filter (EKF); Fractional Order Potential Field (FOPF); Multiple UAVs; Source Seeking; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs)","","J.

The stations which are scattered in different spatial locations provide the navigation information or the control command for the UAV. This paper addresses the optimal path planning problem for a UAV navigated by the NRMS technology to intercept a moving target. This problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem which involves four constraints: the navigation range constraint, the navigation handover constraint, the maximum turning angle constraint, and the time difference constraint. The first two constraints distinguish our problem from other path planning problems. A differential evolution based (DE-based) path planning algorithm is proposed to find a feasible and high-quality path for the UAV.

However, disruption of GPS signals either intentionally or unintentionally could potentially render these algorithms not applicable. In this article, we present a novel method to address this difficulty by combining methods from cooperative localization and routing.

Here we are particularly interested in heterogeneous robots that collaborate in complex scenarios with incomplete, dynamically changing information. In detail, we consider an automated victim search setting, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with different capabilities work together to scan for mobile phones and find and provide information about possible victims near these phone locations. The state of the art for such collaboration is robot control based on independent planning for robots with different tasks and typically incorporates uncertainty with only a limited scope. In contrast, in this paper, we take into account complex relations between robots with different tasks. As a result, we create a joint, full-horizon plan for the whole robot team by optimising over the uncertainty of future information gain using an online planner with hindsight optimisation. This joint plan is also used for further optimisation of individual UAV paths based on the long-term plans of all robots. We evaluate our planner's performance in a realistic simulation environment based on a real disaster and find that our approach finds victims 25% faster compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. © 2017","Hindsight optimisation; Multi-robot teams; Particle filter; Path planning; Search and rescue; Task allocation","Disasters; Distributed computer systems; Emergency services; Motion planning; Robots; Telephone sets; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Multi-robot teams; Optimisations; Particle filter; Search and rescue; Task allocation; Robot programming","Z.

In order to describe the problem, the formation attack process which consists of communication framework and synergy elements is analyzed. The collaborative trajectory planning model which is based on avoiding the threat zones, reducing the execution time, and accomplishing the mission combines kinematics/dynamics model of UCAV with formation relative motion model to establish the optimal control problem. The approach based on hp adaptive pseudospectral method is presented to generate formation trajectory that satisfies the collaborative constraints. When a trigger event is detected, based on the offline planning, the online collaborative trajectory replanning using rolling horizon strategy is carried out.

Such a combination is referred to as a swarm of drones. The use of multiple platforms can extend the system global capacities thanks to the resulting variety of embedded sensors and to information sharing. In this case, path planning and thus obstacles avoidance is still a major task. To deal with this issue, mobility models have to be implemented. Our contribution presented in this paper is a mobility model for swarms of UAVs based on the Artificial Potential Fields (APF) principle. In our model, the involved UAVs collaborate by sharing data about the obstacles that they detected. By doing so, a UAV which is not close enough to an obstacle to detect it thanks to its own sensors will still have the proper data to take this obstacle into account in its path planning. To validate our mobility strategies with realistic constraints we simulate the performances of existing sensors and transmitters, and consider real-world environment. © 2018 IEEE.","","Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Artificial potential fields; Collaborative tasks; Embedded sensors; Information sharing; Mobility strategy; Multiple platforms; Obstacles avoidance; Real world environments; Intelligent robots","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21530858","978-153868094-0","85RBA","","English","IEEE Int Conf Intell Rob Syst","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062970165"

Firstly, extended Kalman filter (EKF) is combined with probability estimation to predict the states of the unknown target. Secondly, the line of sight occlusion of buildings, and energy consumptions of UAVs and sensors are considered in path planning. The objective functions are designed as target coverage degree, control input cost of UAV and sensor energy consumption respectively. The cooperative surveillance path planning problem is transformed into multiobjective optimization with different importance levels. Thirdly, distributed predictive control is used to obtain the local optimal path of each UAV. The predictive states of UAVs in finite horizon are exchanged to build the collision avoidance constraint, and the minimum turning radius constraint is also addressed. Then, all the objectives are fuzzified to handle the different importance level requirement. The sensor energy consumption function with switch value is equivalently converted using Sigmoid function and sign function. According to the principle that the objective with higher priority has higher satisfactory degree, preemptive priorities are transformed into the relaxed order of satisfactory degrees. The best path satisfying the requirement of multiobjective optimization and importance levels can be obtained. Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with traditional multiobjective weighted algorithm. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Cooperative surveillance; Distributed predictive control; Line of sight occlusion; Multiobjective optimization; Path planning; UAVs","Aircraft control; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Energy utilization; Extended Kalman filters; Monitoring; Multiobjective optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Urban planning; Cooperative surveillance; Distributed predictive control; Ground moving targets; Line of Sight; Minimum turning radius; Path planning method; Path planning problems; Probability estimation; Motion planning","C.

In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative exploration framework using a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and a UGV (unmanned ground vehicle). The work is motivated by the wish to combine advantages from different platforms to improve the efficiency in exploration. The ground vehicle carries a long-range laser scanner but travels slowly among obstacles, while the aerial vehicle has a downward-looking stereo camera and flies fast above obstacles. Our algorithm utilizes the complementary features of these two robots and conducts coordinated exploration, while is still flexible that each robot is able to carry out the task independently. In this paper, we combine frontier-based method and motion primitive for local exploration. Also, we adopt a traditional global fail-safe path planning to guide the vehicle to escape local minimum.

UAVs are modeled as Dubins flying vehicles with bounds on the turning radius and flight path climb/descent angle. A Reduced Visibility Graph (RVG) based method, connecting selected nodes by means of circular arcs and segments, is adopted to minimize the length of each path. Then, to keep as much as possible the formation shape while flying between obstacles, the RVG is refined with the addition of so called Rendez-Vous Waypoints (RVWs). These are placed between groups of obstacles where it is impossible to maintain the desired formation. Waypoints locations and UAVs paths are optimized using a bi-level game theoretic approach based on the leader-follower Stackelberg model, where the lower level and upper level problems are the search of the shortest paths and the optimal locations of waypoints respectively. Such an approach allows to fly between obstacles, dispersing the formation and forcing UAVs to recompose it at given waypoints (RVWs) beyond groups of obstacles. Collision avoidance among UAVs and possible non-cooperative aircrafts, called intruders, is then achieved solving a set of linear quadratic optimization problems based on an original geometric based formulation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by means of numerical simulations where RVWs positions are optimized via a genetic algorithm. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Bi-level optimization; Collision avoidance; Formation flight; Guidance; Obstacle avoidance; Path planning; Stackelberg game; Swarm of UAVs","Aircraft accidents; Antennas; Collision avoidance; Electronic guidance systems; Game theory; Genetic algorithms; Graph theory; Motion planning; Quadratic programming; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Bi-level optimization; Formation flight; Linear quadratic optimization; Non-cooperative; Optimal locations; Reduced visibility; Stackelberg Games; Stackelberg model; Flight paths","E.

It is a complicated optimization problem in which target assignment and path planning are solved separately. However, recalculation of the optimal results is too slow for real-time operations in dynamic environments because of the large number of calculations required. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence method named simultaneous target assignment and path planning (STAPP) based on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, which is a type of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. In STAPP, the MUTAPP problem is first constructed as a multi-agent system. Then, the MADDPG framework is used to train the system to solve target assignment and path planning simultaneously according to a corresponding reward structure. The proposed system can deal with dynamic environments effectively as its execution only requires the locations of the UAVs, targets, and threat areas. Real-time performance can be guaranteed as the neural network used in the system is simple. In addition, we develop a technique to improve the training effect and use experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © 2019 IEEE.","dynamic environments; MADDPG; multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-UAV; target assignment and path planning","Antennas; Intelligent agents; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Dynamic environments; MADDPG; Multi UAV; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Target assignments; Motion planning","D.

The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) taking part in a cooperative flight are assumed to be equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) which enables sharing the flight information with neighboring aircrafts. The design and implementation of the flight formation algorithm have been carried out for a general case, such that multiple UAVs with arbitrarily geographically located base stations can take part in the formation flight and collision avoided path planning. The paper formulates the problem of path of planning in the framework of MILP and proposes a cost function that minimizes time and energy consumption. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been verified via a number of simulations carried out using different scenarios.

For aerial vehicles the advantages of performing formation flight include fuel saving, improved efficiency in air traffic control and cooperative task allocation. Besides the benefits of the autonomous formation flight it has some difficulties like providing collision avoidance in narrow flight zone. Furthermore an autonomous formation flight must provide dynamic routines like getting formation position or changing formation schemes. Potential field based autonomous control is one of the commonly used control techniques providing dynamic and precise control. The bottleneck for the potential field based control is computation power needs especially for global path planning for dynamic, high resolution and large sized fields. GPGPU is one of the parallel computing architectures that provide programming massively parallel SIMD applications on GPUs. In this work GPGPU accelerated real-time potential field based formation control approach is designed and examined under simulation environment for UAVs. In order to reveal the precise and dynamic control features high-resolution potential field based global path planning models have been developed in real-time successfully. © 2014 IEEE.","","Fuel economy; Motion planning; Parallel architectures; Program processors; Autonomous control; Control techniques; Cooperative tasks; Formation control; Global path planning; Massively parallels; Parallel computing architecture; Simulation environment; Aircraft","O.

After detecting conflicts between UAVs, the system resolves them cooperatively using a collision-free trajectory planning algorithm based on a stochastic optimization technique named Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The new implementation of the PSO algorithm, named Maneuver Selection Particle Swarm Optimization (MS-PSO), presents improvements with respect to previous implementations. The execution time is reduced because the dimension of the problem is reduced, and different kinds of maneuvers can be selected to solve the detected conflicts: course/heading, speed or altitude changes. The MS-PSO has been validated with simulations in scenarios with multiple UAVs in a common airspace. Also, a comparison to a genetic algorithm and a PSO algorithm has been performed to highlight the advantages of the MS-PSO. The main advantage is that MS-PSO always ensures solution from the first iteration. This requirement is essential in safe cooperative missions. © 2015 IEEE.","","Aircraft accidents; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Redundant manipulators; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Collision-free trajectory planning; Multiple UAVs; PSO algorithms; Stochastic optimization techniques; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147996010-1","","","English","Int.

The cooperating team comprises two vehicles with complementary capabilities, a truck restricted to travel along a street network, and a quadrotor micro-aerial vehicle of capacity one that can be deployed from the truck to perform deliveries. The problem is formulated as an optimal path planning problem on a graph and the goal is to find the shortest cooperative route enabling the quadrotor to deliver items at all requested locations. The problem is shown to be NP-hard. A solution is then proposed using a novel reduction to the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem, for which well-established heuristic solvers exist. The heterogeneous delivery problem contains as a special case the problem of scheduling deliveries from multiple static warehouses. We propose two additional algorithms, based on enumeration and a reduction to the traveling salesman problem, for this special case. Simulation results compare the performance of the presented algorithms and demonstrate examples of delivery route computations over real urban street maps. © 2015 IEEE.","Generalized traveling salesman problem; optimal path planning; unmanned aerial vehicles; Urban delivery","Amphibious vehicles; Micro air vehicle (MAV); Motion planning; Scheduling; Trucks; Vehicles; Cooperating vehicles; Delivery problems; Generalized traveling salesman problem; Micro aerial vehicle; Multi-robot teams; Optimal path planning; Path planning problems; Urban environments; Traveling salesman problem","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15455955","","","","English","IEEE Trans.

In this paper, a hierarchical path generation scheme for improving the adaptability and performance of the distributed mission planning (DMP) system of the UAVs is proposed. The effectiveness of the market-based task allocation is enhanced by conducting a rough path planning beforehand, where only the neighboring forbidden areas of the vehicles are considered for a tradeoff between the planning accuracy and the computation. The subsequent refined path planning, which provides the guidance information to the control system, is also presented to assess the precision level of the rough path planning and the mission execution reward of the UAV fleet.

Nowadays, there are many outdoor and indoor applications where teams of robots and unmanned vehicles are very useful. In these cases the ability of autonomous navigation and adaptive motion control is given by trajectory planning methods. Furthermore, trajectory planning methods are very important in cooperative applications. A subset of trajectory planning methods focus on finding the optimal solution given by a specific criterion. A constrained problem has to be solved when two or more vehicles share the same space in a multiple vehicle application.We present a new optimal trajectory planning method based on pseudospectral collocation methods, which are especially suitable for multivehicle problems. Pseudospectral collocation methods are based on the solving of numerically optimal control problems by effective discretization and conversion to an algebraic nonlinear programming problem, which can be efficiently solved by application of optimization tools. We consider several kinds of applications and scenarios with multiple aerial and ground vehicles. Experimental results with teams of unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles are provided to validate the multivehicle trajectories obtained by the methods. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Due to the limited capabilities of UAVs, including human partners in the search process is promising to tackle many realistic applications that mere UAVs are not sufficient to deal with. This paper presents a collaboration scheme using a human-UAV team to cooperatively localize a stationary missing target. To achieve efficient collaboration, Bayesian inverse planning approach is utilized for inferring the goal area that human plans to search. By incorporating the inferred human goal into a model predictive control-based path planning framework, the UAV is able to design effective search path to assist in localizing the target in the human’s goal area. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a simulated target search scenario. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Artificial potential field (APF) UAV path planning method is often employed to build an intuitive model which is updated by the additional forces pushing the trajectory away from threats of non-cooperative objects and toward the predefined target. However, APF has its own weaknesses, one of which is the local minima close to concave obstacles. To tackle situation mentioned above, we propose a novel additional force model based on virtual waypoints. This model provides additional forces for candidate planning points falling into local minimum area and help them escape from local minimum area. Once the candidate is trapped in minimum area, firstly we calculate measure factor according to the planning area containing current candidate and the target point, and thus determine position of the virtual waypoint. Then the virtual waypoint generates additional control force so that the candidate can run away from the local minimum area. Finally, the simulation results show that the method can solve the local minimum problem in planning space. © 2016 IEEE.","","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Additional control; Additional forces; Artificial potential field method; Artificial potential fields; Concave obstacle; Intuitive modeling; Local minimum problem; Path planning method; Motion planning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-146738318-9","","","English","CGNCC - IEEE Chin.

In order to play the better role of UAV, it is needed to utilize multi UAVs cooperative formation to accomplish cooperative reconnaissance, combat, defense and spraying pesticides and other tasks. The multi UAVs cooperative formation control technology mainly contains the following key techniques: data fusion technology, sensing technology, task allocation technology, path planning technology, formation control technology, communication network technology and virtual/physical verification platform technology. Firstly, summarize the research and development of key technologies worldwide. Then, the classification for multi UAVs formation control methods is mainly investigated, and the problems about formation design and adjustment, formation reconfiguration are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future development for multi UAV cooperative formation are prospected. Research shows: at present, the theory of multi UAV formation flight has acquired fruitful results, while the real cooperative formation flight test can only be implemented in the simple communication environment. The real time performance for task allocation and path planning is not high. The robustness of control methods to cope with the unexpected situation is low. The cooperative sensing ability for multi UAV with multi sensor is insufficient. The simulation of the entity is lacked. Breaking through the above key technologies, carrying out the cooperative formation flight of multi UAV in complex sensing constraints and complex communication environment, putting forward more effective control method and carrying out the UAV physical formation flying test so that the UAV can finish the task better may be the future research directions. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology.

The probability map consists of cells that display the probability which the UAV will not encounter a hostile threat. The probability map is defined by three events. The obstacles are modeled in the probability map, as well. The cost function is defined such that all cells are surveyed in the path track. The simple formula based on the unique vector is presented to find this cell position. Generally, the cost function is formed by two parts; one part for optimizing the path of each UAV and the other for preventing UAVs from collision. The first part is a combination of safety and length of path and the second part is formed by an exponential function. Then, the optimal paths of each UAV are obtained by the genetic algorithm in a parallel form. According to the dimensions of path planning, genetic encoding has two or three indices. A new genetic operator is introduced to select an appropriate pair of chromosome for crossover operation. The effectiveness of the method is shown by several simulations.

For the purpose of forming the initial airborne communication relay chain, a novel method for cooperative path planning is proposed to ensure simultaneous arrival of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with initial and terminal course angle constraints, which is realized by adopting the minimum turning radius of Dubins curves and appropriately adjusting the course angle. For the random moving target, establishing continuous reliable communication relay chain is implemented by using distributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), considering the constraints of UAVs dynamics, communication constraints, collision avoidance and so on. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2015, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications.

While prior attempts have been made to perform collaborative autonomy, the high complexity of UA systems in general and the planning in particular, have resulted in centralized solutions that tend to be brittle and lack scalability, or in distributed approaches that incur high overheads and require over-simplifying assumptions. In contrast, we propose an approach that is an inherently scalable (linear in the number of tasks, per UA (parallelizable over the UAs) per update) and performs distributed joint task assignment and trajectory planning using local laws analogous to those in natural processes. More specifically, trajectories are planned using the artificial potential force method, with goals and neighbors modeled as attractive forces and hazards modeled as repulsive forces. Additionally, task assignments are regulated using dynamic valences that are associated with the goal positions of trajectory planning. This approach allows the incorporation of dynamics and feedback laws to guarantee equilibrium stability. When applied to a scenario of simulated communication networking in harsh environment, our results show that NICiTA is able to build a relay UA data network that has near perfect data-delivery ratio despite the presence of a nearby interferer. © 2015 IEEE.","agent system; artificial potential field; autonomy; coordination; distributed control; Lyapunov; mobile robotics; multi-robot; self-organization; task allocation; UAV","Complex networks; Distributed parameter control systems; Lyapunov methods; Motion planning; Robotics; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agent systems; Artificial potential fields; autonomy; coordination; Distributed control; Mobile robotic; Multirobots; Self organizations; Task allocation; Military communications","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-150900073-9","PMICE","","English","Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959263051"

To extend their range of application and provide a further effective option for remote surveillance, unmanned aerial vehicles have been gradually introduced into sensor networks, due to their advantages of flexibility, mobility, and ease of realization. Despite the success of various applications and studies in this new field, unmanned aerial vehicle-wireless sensor network still faces many open challenges, such as the unmanned aerial vehicle capable system framework, land-wireless sensor network management, and unmanned aerial vehicle mission planning strategies. In the article, we propose a cooperative framework for unmanned aerial vehicle-wireless sensor network, which is composed of sensor nodes, fixed-group leaders, and a unmanned aerial vehicle-Sink, in which a three-layer hierarchical network is formed. A land-wireless sensor network k-means driven grouping approach is then presented, which considers the communication performance, the position, and other factors. Additionally, a simulated annealing algorithm is employed to detect the optimal flight trajectory according the ground wireless sensor network architecture.

Consequently, in this paper, a novel approach for estimation of the location and height of an obstacle between two UAVs using RSSI observations is proposed which would help to better estimate the location of a radio frequency (RF) source. The long-term goal of developing this approach is to improve the localization of an RF source by removing the effect of obstacle(s) on the signal attenuation. This approach is based on path planning of the UAVs to estimate the tip of the obstacle between them. The change in the diffraction loss observations are used to find the Line Of Sight (LOS) positions of the UAVs. These LOS lines, constructed by connecting the UAVs in LOS situation, are the locus of the tip of the obstacle and used in an iterative geometrical approach for estimation of the location of the tip of the obstacle. Due to the uncertainty in determining the LOS position which is created because of the radius of the Fresnel zone, the motion steps of UAVs, and the non-modeled dynamics in signal attenuation, an EKF filter is used to estimate the tip of the obstacle. The approach has been simulated and the results show that the approach provides better accuracy in RF source localization compared to the basic approach which does not consider the obstacles in the localization process. © 2014 IEEE.","Obstacle Mapping; RSSI observation; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Location; Mapping; Signal processing; Uncertainty analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Diffraction loss; Distance estimation; Geometrical approaches; Obstacle mapping; Radio frequency source; Received signal strength indication; RSSI observation; Signal attenuation; Frequency estimation","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147996743-8","","","English","RSI/ISM Int.

In the most dangerous environment, human’s wisdom, experience and synthetic judgments can make up for the lack of intelligence algorithm. By using variable length gene encoding based on angle for the flight paths planning, and combining artificial auxiliary decision with novel intelligence algorithm, it makes the best possible use of the human brain to guide solution procedures of the flight path planning on pop-up threats. A lot of simulation studies show that the on-line three-dimensional flight paths by this technology can meet the requirements of UAV low-altitude penetration, efficient implementation of threat avoidance, terrain avoidance and terrain following.

First, LGVF method is improved for UAV cooperative target tracking in 3D environment by introducing vertical component, with two guidance layers containing steering control and speed control. Second, IIFDS method is presented for UAVs to avoid obstacles or threats in complicated environment, where the local minimum problem is well resolved. Moreover, some cooperative strategies are added into the IIFDS framework to satisfy the constraints of obstacle avoidance and cluster maintenance. Finally, the missions of tracking target and avoiding obstacles can be performed simultaneously, by replacing the original sink fluid of IIFDS with the vector field of LGVF. Besides, the reactive parameters of IIFDS can be adjusted by the rolling optimization strategy to enhance the path quality.

The presented system is also capable of an off-line marker-less 3D reconstruction from monocular images with increased detail. This method is designed for the flexible use with an Unmaned Aerial Vehicle (UAV); this means that, despite being tested with a Parrot AR.Drone 1.0, it is easily portable to other more capable UAV models. The followed approach was an adaptation of the patchbased Multiview Stereo (PMVS) algorithm for on line point cloud generation. The system achieved 1.05 processed images per second on average, slightly surpassing the planed objective of 1 processed image per second. The height estimation error ranges between 1-1.5% with a manual marker detection and 4-5% with automatic marker detection, which seems accurate enough for autonomous navigation and path planning.

Chaotic sequence is used to improve the RRT algorithm. The improved RRT is applied in online path replanning to round unexpected threats detected while flying along the pre-path, which is designed in advance and satisfies time cooperativity. Because time cooperativity is destroyed by path replanning, a time cooperativity reconstruction strategy is proposed, which is realized by adjusting the flight velocities associate with the circling motions so that all UAVs can reach the destination at the same time. Finally, the simulations are carried out to evaluate the effect of key parameters, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative path replanning method. © IMechE 2014.","cooperative path planning; Formation flight; obstacle collision avoidance; path replanning; unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Collision avoidance; Timing circuits; Trees (mathematics); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Chaotic sequence; Cooperative path planning; Flight velocity; Formation flight; Obstacle collision; Path re-planning; Rapidly-exploring random trees; Timing constraints; Flight paths","Z.

The novelty of the algorithm is that it takes into account vision occlusions due to obstacles in the environment. The algorithm uses a dynamic occupancy grid to model the target state, which is updated by sensor measurements using a Bayesian filter. Based on the current and predicted target behavior, the path planning algorithm for a single vehicle (UAV/UGV) is first designed to maximize the sum of the probability of detection over a finite look-ahead horizon. The algorithm is then extended to multiple vehicle collaboration scenarios, where a decentralized planning algorithm relying on an auction scheme is designed to plan finite look-ahead paths that maximize the sum of the joint probability of detection over all vehicles. © 2014 IEEE.","Cooperative control; miniature air vehicles; path planning; target tracking","Target tracking; Co-operative control; Cooperative path planning; Miniature Air Vehicles; Unmanned air; Urban environments; Motion planning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10834435","","IATEF","","English","IEEE ASME Trans Mechatron","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908399248"

Due to the uncertainties of the application environments and objects’ motion, it is difficult to maintain the tracked object always within the sensor coverage area by using a single UAV. Hence, it is necessary to deploy a group of UAVs to improve the robustness of the tracking. This paper investigates the problem of tracking ground moving objects with a group of UAVs using gimbaled sensors under flight dynamic and collision-free constraints. The optimal cooperative tracking path planning problem is solved using an evolutionary optimization technique based on the framework of chemical reaction optimization (CRO). The efficiency of the proposed method was demonstrated through a series of comparative simulations. The results show that the cooperative tracking paths determined by the newly developed method allows for longer sensor coverage time under flight dynamic restrictions and safety conditions. © 2017 by the authors.

This is due to the fact that both these objectives require the manipulation of sensors' physical locations. We introduce a new relay-assisted communication model to decouple these two aspects so that each one can be optimized independently. However, using additional relay nodes is at the expense of an increased number of transmissions and reduced spectrum efficiency. Theoretical results based on mutual information and average data rate of the model reveal that such drawbacks can be compensated if the sensor nodes are carefully arranged into groups. Based on these results, we further propose a pairing strategy to maximize the spectrum efficiency gain. Simulation experiments have confirmed the performance of this strategy in terms of improved efficiency. We provide a simple example to demonstrate the application of this model in cooperative sensing scenarios where multiple UAVs are deployed to explore an unknown area. © 2014 IEEE.","Connectivity; cooperative sensing; optimization; path planning; sensor networks; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); wireless communication","Efficiency; Information theory; Motion planning; Optimization; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles; Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication modeling; Connectivity; Cooperative sensing; Multiple mobile robot; Mutual informations; Number of transmissions; Relay-assisted communication; Wireless communications; Cooperative communication","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","00189545","","ITVTA","","English","IEEE Trans.

The results show that the parallel CFO-GA algorithm converges faster than the parallel CFO and the central force optimization-sequential quadratic programming (CFO-SQP) algorithm. Then, the trajectory planning problem is established based on the path planning results. In order to limit the range of the attitude angle and guarantee the flight stability, the optimized object is changed from the ordinary six-degree-of-freedom rigid-body dynamic model to the dynamic model with an inner-loop attitude controller. The results show that the trajectory planning process can be solved by the mature SQP algorithm easily. Finally, the discussion and analysis of the real-time performance of the hierarchic optimization strategy are presented around the group number of the waypoints and the equal interval time. © 2016 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA & BUAA.","Hierarchic optimization strategy; Parallel CFO-GA algorithm; Path planning; Six-degree-of-freedom rigid-body dynamic model; Trajectory optimization; Trajectory planning","Aerodynamics; Algorithms; Attitude control; Automobile bodies; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Digital control systems; Discrete time control systems; Dynamic models; End effectors; Free flight; Genetic algorithms; Motion planning; Quadratic programming; Rigid structures; Trajectories; GA algorithm; Hierarchic optimizations; Six-degree of-freedom rigid bodies; Trajectory optimization; Trajectory Planning; Optimization","J.

Using the UAV, a ground image can be obtained from the aerial vision, which is then processed with image denoising, image correction, and obstacle recognition to construct the ground map automatically. Image correction is used to help the UGV improve the recognition accuracy of obstacles. Based on the constructed ground map, a hybrid path planning algorithm is proposed to optimize the planned path. A genetic algorithm is used for global path planning, and a local rolling optimization is used to constantly optimize the results of the genetic algorithm. Experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach can obtain a much less costly path compared to the traditional path planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm and the A-star algorithm and can run in real-time to support the UAV/UGV systems. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Hybrid path planning; obstacle identification; unmanned air vehicle; unmanned ground vehicle","Fighter aircraft; Genetic algorithms; Ground vehicles; Hybrid vehicles; Image denoising; Image reconstruction; Motion planning; Optimization; Real time systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicles; Co-operative systems; Efficient path planning; Global path planning; Hybrid path planning; Path-planning algorithm; Recognition accuracy; Unmanned air vehicle (UAVs); Unmanned ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","C.

For multi-agent scenarios in dynamic environments, a candidate algorithm should be able to replan for a new path to perform the given tasks without any collision with obstacles or other agents. The path-planning algorithm proposed here is based on the visibility and shortest-path principles in Euclidean space. Instead of typical visibility graph-based methods that scan through all nodes, A* algorithm is adopted to find an admissible path in a “best-first” approach during the search process. Since the direct outcome from such algorithms may not produce admissible paths in complex environments due to the problems including cul-de-sac, additional procedures are conceived to find a solution with a lower cost by avoiding local minima and eliminating any redundant nodes. The path planner is augmented with a potential field-based trajectory planner, which solves for a detouring trajectory around other agents or pop-up obstacles. Task assignment is achieved by a negotiation-based algorithm, which assigns a task with the lowest cost to each agent after comparing all task costs of all participating agents. These algorithms are implemented on MATLAB/Simulink, which can run with simulated vehicle models or actual UAVs through a communication network. In the simulations, the algorithms were validated to perform task assignment and path planning flawlessly. In actual flight tests, the proposed algorithms were tested with a number of fixed-wing UAVs in a fully realistic situation under various reality factors such as communication loss or tracking errors. The flight test shows, even in the presence of such uncertainties and logistic factors, the algorithms were able to perform all of the given tasks without any collision with other agents or obstacles. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Fixed wings; Graph theory; Graphic methods; MATLAB; Multi agent systems; Visibility; Collision with obstacle; Communication loss; Complex environments; Cooperative tasks; Dynamic environments; Path-planning algorithm; Simulated vehicles; Visibility graphs; Software agents","","","Springer Netherlands","","978-904819707-1; 2014944662; 978-904819706-4","","","English","Handb. of Unmanned Aer.

The common application domains for small UAV swarms are surveillance, path planning, air-bone and as relay networks. Cooperative applications make use of the UAVs' locations to make decisions. However, security vulnerabilities must be considered when the system infers rights based on the UAV's location. An attacker can cheat the system by declaring a false or inaccurate location to gain access to resources that are restricted or to undertake malicious activities without detection. In this paper, we propose the use of a UAV payload stereo camera to measure the distance between a UAV, called a prover node, and the set of closest verifier nodes. Using a multilateration algorithm to estimate the prover's position, we performed simulations for two cameras with different capabilities. The simulations showed that the proposed technique provides 98% validation accuracy for distances up to 50 m for 1280×720-resolution cameras and more than 99% validation accuracy for distances up to 100 m for 1920×1080-resolution cameras. For distances greater than 100 m between the prover and the verifiers, the accuracy depends exclusively on the stereo camera with the highest capacity.

In this paper, a multiple unmanned combat aerial vehicle (multi-UCAV) cooperative autonomous attack path planning method under complex and uncertain environment is put forward. A general framework of multi-UCAV cooperative combat and autonomous attack is designed. Then, the relative movement situation of the UCAV formation is studied and the task assignment model for attacking multi-target is established. On this basis, an improved ant colony algorithm (ACA) is used to solve the corresponding optimal problem. By taking the three degrees of freedom model of UCAV as a core and considering various constraints such as aerodynamic characteristics, thrust variation, target projection area and threat area, an accurate cooperative autonomous attack path planning model for multi-UCAV is built and an improved rolling pseudospectral method(RPM) is applied to calculate the optimal trajectory from the current location to the launch acceptable region. Simulation results show that the proposed ACA and RPM can deal with the task assignment and path planning of multi-UCAV effectively, and they have higher precision and better real-time compared with some existed methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Cooperative autonomous attack; Path planning; Uncertainty; Unmanned combat aerial vehicle(UCAV)","Ant colony optimization; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Information management; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Military vehicles; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicles; Aerodynamic characteristics; Cooperative autonomous attack; Improved ant colony algorithm; Pseudospectral methods; Three degrees of freedom; Uncertain environments; Uncertainty; Unmanned combat aerial vehicles; Motion planning","","Xu B.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-146739612-7","","","English","Proc.

The unmanned aerial vehicles do not possess sensors with automated target recognition capability and, thus, rely on communicating with unattended ground sensors placed on roads to detect and image potential intruders. The problem is motivated by persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and base defense missions. The problem is formulated and shown to be intractable. A heuristic algorithm to coordinate the unmanned aerial vehicles during surveillance and pursuit is presented. Revisit deadlines are used to schedule the vehicles’ paths nominally. The algorithm uses detections from the sensors to predict intruders’ locations and selects the vehicles’ paths by minimizing a linear combination of missed deadlines and the probability of not intercepting intruders. An analysis of the algorithm’s completeness and complexity is then provided. The effectiveness of the heuristic is illustrated through simulations in a variety of scenarios. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Path planning for multiple UAVs; Sensor networks; Target tracking","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Heuristic algorithms; Monitoring; Motion planning; Sensor networks; Target tracking; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Automated target recognition; Cooperative surveillance; Defense missions; Image-potential; Intelligence , surveillance , reconnaissances; Linear combinations; Multiple UAVs; Unattended ground sensors; Unattended sensors","J.

With a path formation based on Dubins vehicle paths, a genetic algorithm has been developed for finding the optimal solution from the graph to achieve the following goals: (1) completion of the three tasks on each target, (2) avoidance of FPZs, (3) low level of exposure to enemy radar detection, and (4) short overall flying path length.

With efficient algorithms for UAV task planning, the UAVs can autonomously serve the customers in real time. Nearly uninterrupted customer service may be accomplished via the cooperative hand-off of customer tasks from weary UAVs to ones that have recently been replenished at an LSS. With the goal of enabling the autonomy of the task planning tasks, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the problem of providing simultaneous. UAV escort service to multiple customers across a field of operations with multiple sharable LSSs. This MILP model provides a formal representation of our problem and enables use in a rolling horizon planner via allowance of arbitrary UAV initial locations and consumable reservoir status (e.g., battery level). As such, it enables automation of the orchestration of system activities. To address computational complexity, we develop efficient heuristics to rapidly derive near optimal solutions. A receding horizon task assignment (RHTA) heuristic and sequential task assignment heuristic (STAH) are developed. STAH exploits properties observed in optimal solutions obtained for small problems via CPLEX. Numerical studies suggest that RHTA and STAH are 45 and 2100 times faster than solving the MILP via CPLEX, respectively. Both heuristics perform well relative to the optimal solution obtained via CPLEX. An example demonstrating the use of the approach for rolling horizon planning is provided. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cooperative UAV service; Heuristic; Mixed integer linear programming; Persistent UAV service; UAV task planning","Algorithms; Heuristic programming; Motion planning; Networked control systems; Optimal systems; Optimization; Sales; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cooperative UAV service; Heuristic; Mixed integer linear programming; Persistent UAV service; Task planning; Integer programming","J.R.

Since the conventional vehicle-routing algorithms approximate their path to straight lines to reduce computational load, the physical constraints imposed on the vehicle are not to be taken into account. In order to mitigate this issue, this chapter describes a framework allowing integrated mission and path planning for coordinating UAVs using the Dubins theory based on the differential geometry concepts which can consider non-straight path segments. The main advantage of this approach is that the number of design parameters can be significantly reduced while providing the shortest, safe, and feasible path, which leads to a fast design process and more lightweight algorithms. In order to validate the integrated framework, cooperative mission and path-planning algorithms for two missions are developed: (1) road-network search route-planning patrolling every road segment of interest efficiently based on the optimization and approximation algorithm using nearest insertion and auction negotiation and (2) communication-relay route planning between a ground control station and the friendly fleet satisfying the constraints on the UAV speed and the avoidance of nonflying zones. Lastly, the performance of the proposed algorithms is examined via numerical simulations. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","","Approximation algorithms; Computation theory; Cooperative communication; Geometry; Highway planning; Motion planning; Optimization; Roads and streets; Rock mechanics; Unmanned vehicles; Vehicles; Autonomous unmanned vehicles; Communication relays; Differential geometry; Ground control stations; Integrated frameworks; Path planning problems; Path-planning algorithm; Vehicle Routing Problems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","","","Springer Netherlands","","978-904819707-1; 2014944662; 978-904819706-4","","","English","Handb. of Unmanned Aer.

Existing methods either rely on satellite observations, or only rely on UAV observations. Even though the two cooperative observations, it confined to a simple task allocation. They did not solve the problem of maritime moving targets continuation observation. On the basis of difference between satellites observation and UAV observation, we constructed the aerospace collaborative continuation observation model for maritime moving target, and put forward aerospace collaborative continuation observation strategy (ACCOS) to reduce the complexity of solving the model. According to the spatial and temporal characteristics of the task, ACCOS extracted five sub problems to solve the model: Satellite planning, UAV flight plan, UAV observation sequence, target potential area and distribution probability density prediction, UAV path planning. In order to realize the optimization goal of the model, the five sub problems are modelled and solved in turn. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the average observation period of the target, and effectively solve the problem of the continuous observation of maritime moving target. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2016.","","Highway engineering; Motion planning; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Satellites; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Continuous observation; Cooperative observations; Distribution probability; Observation model; Observation Period; Optimization goals; Satellite observations; Temporal characteristics; Problem solving","","Figueira M.; Guo Z.","EDP Sciences","2261236X","","","","English","MATEC Web Conf.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84996497300"

Firstly, a dynamic guidance A* (DGA*) search algorithm is proposed to allow human’s participation in machine searching loop. Secondly, online uncertainty reasoning based on cloud model is introduced to allow human’s fuzzy decision about path direction and trending, then human’s perception, expertise, and preferences are incorporated into the DGA* optimality process. Therefore, this effective cooperative decision support can provide a robust solution exploration space, overcoming some shortages of original A* algorithm, such as slow search speed, easily falling into local dead-ends, and so on. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is much more efficient than original A* planner, and generates good solutions that match mission considerations and personal preferences. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cloud model; Dynamic guidance A* (DGA*) search; Human-machine cooperation; Path planning; Uncertainty reasoning","Cloud computing; Decision support systems; Man machine systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles; Cloud modeling; Cluttered environments; Cooperative path planning; Human-in-the-loop; Human-machine cooperation; Planning strategies; Search Algorithms; Uncertainty reasoning; Motion planning","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers","09210296","","JIRSE","","English","J Intell Rob Syst Theor Appl","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930482608"

Traditionally, UAV can locate itself using GPS combined with some inertial sensors. However, due to the complex flight environment or failure of the GPS receiver, the UAV may lose its GPS signal and fail to locate itself, resulting in devastating consequence. In this paper, we will consider the problem of cooperative localization among multiple UAVs, in which the UAVs with failure of GPS receiver can help each other to locate themselves through mutual information exchanged based on the relative distance measurements. Specifically, we propose a dynamic Nonparametric Belief Propagation (dNBP) algorithm to calculate the posterior distribution of UAV's position conditioned on all observations made in the whole UAVs group. The dNBP is a natural combination of NBP with particle filtering, suitable for treating with the nonlinear model and highly non-Gaussian distributions arising in our application. Furthermore, dNBP provides the basis for distributed algorithm in which messages are exchanges between neighboring UAVs. Thus, the computational burden is distributed across UAVs. Simulations in Matlab environment show the effectiveness of our method. © 2014 Jiuqing Wan et al.","","Algorithms; Global positioning system; MATLAB; Motion planning; Signal receivers; Computational burden; Cooperative localization; Flight environment; Mutual informations; Non-gaussian distribution; Non-parametric belief propagation; Particle Filtering; Posterior distributions; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","J.

Sharing the detected threat information of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) with other UAVs is expected to help them improve the path quality of cooperative path planning. However, it does not always come up to the expectation due to the diversity of the owned information and the shared information. Motivated by this, in this work we investigate the impacts of sharing threat information on UAV path planning by figuring out the characteristics of threat environments with information sharing. Furthermore, a new path planning approach based on three adaptive strategies are proposed to adapt to the diversity.

However, the successful execution of such tasks often hinges upon accurate position information, which is needed in lower-level locomotion and path-planning algorithms. Common techniques for the localization of mobile robots are the classical preinstalled beacon-based localization algorithms, fixed feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms, and Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation. However, these localization techniques work based on assumptions such as the existence of distinct and static features that can be revisited often or line of sight to GPS satellites, which may not be feasible for operations such as search and rescue, environment monitoring, and oceanic exploration. In the case of GPS navigation, there is also a current concern about signal jamming for outdoor navigation, especially for unmanned aerial vehicle coordination and control. Instead, cooperative localization is emerging as an alternative localization technique that can be employed in such scenarios. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","","Ad hoc networks; Air navigation; Algorithms; Bandpass filters; Global positioning system; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile robots; Motion planning; Navigation; Robotics; Robots; Tracking (position); Unmanned vehicles; Cooperative localization; Coordination and Control; Decentralized algorithms; Electromechanical systems; Localization algorithm; Localization of mobile robots; Path-planning algorithm; Simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms; Mobile agents","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1066033X","","","","English","IEEE Control Syst.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963738304"

A target may need up to three tasks (i.e., classification, attack, and verification) to be carried out in sequence. The problem is addressed in two decision-making stages. First, the shortest feasible flying path for a UAV to fly between any pair of task locations is obtained using a customized A∗algorithm. During the search, constraints such as collision avoidance from terrain, circumvention of flight prohibition zones, and the flying capabilities of UAVs are considered. In the second stage, with the obtained UAV flying paths between task locations, mission planning is modeled as a vehicle routing problem (VRP) with time window and precedence requirements. A genetic algorithm with a built-in mixed integer programming (MIP) solver is developed to solve the problem. The outputs of this proposed planning system include (1) task assignment among the UAVs, (2) mission execution schedule for each UAV, and (3) flying paths of the UAVs. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","genetic algorithm; mixed integer programming; UAV mission planning; UAV path planning; VRP","Antennas; Decision making; Flight paths; Genetic algorithms; Motion planning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle routing; Mission execution; Mission Planning System; Mixed integer programming; Mixed integer programming (MIP); Multiple targets; Realistic environments; UAV missions; Vehicle routing problem; Integer programming","","","World Scientific Publishing Co.

One possible scenario for these sUAV is to use them in a cooperative flights. In this case one UAV finds Points of Interest and the others inspect them based on each UAV's capabilities. This scenario requires that the path planning algorithm is executed by the embedded processors such that the UAVs can collaborate directly. This paper presents a path planning algorithm based on Simulated Annealing for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The objective of the algorithm is to find flight paths to allow the UAVs to inspect numerous points of interest placed over a region, considering that these points may belong to different kinds and should be inspected by specific type of UAV. This is considered as a multiple Traveler Salesman Problem, solved by the proposed SA algorithm where the Energy function takes into account the mismatches between POI type and UAV specialty. The algorithm is implemented on a Raspberry Pi and tested using a ArduCopter platform flight simulator, considering two inspector UAVs. The results show that the algorithm is capable of calculating paths matching POI and UAV types with an execution time that is suitable for on-the-fly mission generation. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

The probability map consists of cells that display the probability which the UAV will not encounter a hostile threat. The probability map is defined by three events. The obstacles are modeled in the probability map, as well. The cost function is defined such that all cells are surveyed in the path track. The simple formula based on the unique vector is presented to find this cell position. Generally, the cost function is formed by two parts; one part for optimizing the path of each UAV and the other for preventing UAVs from collision. The first part is a combination of safety and length of path and the second part is formed by an exponential function. Then, the optimal paths of each UAV are obtained by the genetic algorithm in a parallel form. According to the dimensions of path planning, genetic encoding has two or three indices. A new genetic operator is introduced to select an appropriate pair of chromosome for crossover operation. The effectiveness of the method is shown by several simulations.

A multi-objective optimization algorithm for cooperative path planning of multi-UAV, which is named as cooperated non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms-II(CO-NSGA-II) is proposed for planning track distance, safety, spatial and time cooperativity of multi-UAV. By using the multi-objective optimization algorithm, the deficiency of taking weight for every objective function in the traditional path planning is overcame, and can get multiple alternative results. Meanwhile, by introducing the co-evolution strategy, the path planning of each UAV is treated as sub population, the best individual is used to cooperate between sub populations, and multiple objectives are optimized by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms-II(NSGA-II) respectively in each sub population. Considering spatial and time constraints of UAV, the parameter of “crowding distance” in traditional algorithm is replaced by the parameter of spatial and time cooperativity. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve cooperative path planning of multi-UAV effectively. © 2017, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

To solve the problem of multi-UAVs cooperative path planning with kinds of constraints, a multi-objective optimization approach based on differential evolution is proposed, which uses a group of UAV paths as evolution individuals. In this paper, we adopt a novel combined strategy to enhance the efficiency of difference. To fit UAV constraints and cooperative constraints, a cooperative fitness function is given to measure the pare to optimal solution. And then the control vertexes of a B-spline curve are calculated reversely to get a group of flyable smoothing paths for UAVs. The simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively improves the cooperative accuracy and works well in smoothing paths for UAVs. © 2014 IEEE.","B-spline; differential evolution; multi objective optimization; multi UAVs; path planning","Evolutionary algorithms; Interpolation; Motion planning; Multiobjective optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); B spline curve; B splines; Cooperative path planning; Differential Evolution; Fitness functions; Optimal solutions; Smoothing algorithms; Three-dimensional environment; Curve fitting","","Li J.-B.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147996575-5","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Thus this paper investigates a cooperative path planning for rendezvous of UAVs with constant speed. To achieve both wandering maneuver with shorter range-to-go and circle maneuver with longer range-to-go, UAVs calculate the minimum maneuver distance to target in real time in order to plan a Dubins path as a reference. Based on this path, the UAV with shorter range-togo re-plans the waiting maneuver to extend the path length. In addition, as the UAV with longer range-to-go also follows this manner, the UAVs will arrive at the boundary of the target execution range at the same time. To reduce the risk of collision in this range, the UAVs fly along the Dubins path to minimize the execution time. The simulation results show that the UAVs can perform cooperative path planning for rendezvous in target execution range by using the proposed method, and it is easy to implement the corresponding control law, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the method. © 2015, Science Press.

Paths are planned to maximise the amount of information from desired region while accounting for the trajectory length. In this paper, an exploration system is proposed for specific cases with shifting directions such as rivers and lakes. Taking account of data synchronisation errors, this method maximises the amount of information value and optimises the path length. Desired region is divided into grids based on required image resolution as well as time needed during the process. Analyses show that the real area and path length are closely related to the yaw angle of UAVs. The path planning issue is studied as an optimisation problem and has been solved by a modified depth-first search method. Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, in which the UAV performs a task to track targets on a flowing river.
