  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are steadily replacing conventional manned aerial vehicles in multitude of tasks. Many of those tasks can be performed more efficiently by using a coordination between a team of UAVs rather than a single UAV. In this paper problem of cooperative area coverage using team of UAVs is addressed. Digital pheromones are used to convey information about search area. UAVs communicate indirectly by depositing and sensing digital pheromones which exist in pheromone map. Two approaches for path planning using pheromone maps are proposed. First approach is based on genetic algorithm, whereas second one relies on roulette wheel selection. Both approaches are evaluated in terms of distance required to cover given percentage of the area.},

  abstract={This paper presents a control scheme via feedback linearization for three dimensional cooperative path planning of a class of interconnected systems in general and UAVs in particular. It is shown that the feedback linearization technique along with a distance varied repulsive profile allows UAVs to converge to the invariant set of a known target location without colliding with other vehicles. Lyapunov stability analysis shows the conditions under which such systems are stable. Also a task assignment algorithm, which is a function of distance between the UAVs and the target, is proposed for dealing with multi-UAV and multi-target scenario},

  abstract={Given that the substation is an important node of the electric power system, and its operational status directly affects the stability and security of the power supply, regular and efficient inspections of the substation are of vital significance. A more comprehensive and finer inspection can be realized through the collaborative inspection of UAVs and ground-based intelligent robots. In this paper, we design a system for cooperative inspection of substations by robots and drones, and propose a multi-machine cooperative global path planning based on the improved A* algorithm and Bezier curves, which effectively reduces the number of bends and advances smoothly. The search time and the nodes to be selected of the improved A* algorithm are significantly shortened compared to both the breadth-first search and the traditional A* algorithm, while the number of corners in the same path is reduced from 21 to 5. At the same time, the robot is taken as the main body of path planning, the UAV follows in real time, and a new distributed feedback strategy is designed to control the motion of the point model on the plane, which controls the local relative position to realize the multi-intelligence body consistency formation without using the tree structure by methods such as dynamic feedback linearization. In addition to this, the UAV is also considered to be subject to electromagnetic interference from the substation, which ensures the safety of inspection while inspecting efficiently.},

  abstract={The future of 3D printing utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents a promising capability to revolutionize manufacturing and to enable the creation of large-scale structures in remote and hard-to-reach areas e.g. in other planetary systems. Nevertheless, the limited payload capacity of UAVs and the complexity in the 3D printing of large objects pose significant challenges. In this article we propose a novel chunk-based framework for distributed 3D printing using UAVs that sets the basis for a fully collaborative aerial 3D printing of challenging structures. The presented framework, through a novel proposed optimisation process, is able to divide the 3D model to be printed into small, manageable chunks and to assign them to a UAV for partial printing of the assigned chunk, in a fully autonomous approach. Thus, we establish the algorithms for chunk division, allocation, and printing, and we also introduce a novel algorithm that efficiently partitions the mesh into planar chunks, while accounting for the inter-connectivity constraints of the chunks. The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated through multiple physics based simulations in Gazebo, where a CAD construction mesh is printed via multiple UAVs carrying materials whose volume is proportionate to a fraction of the total mesh volume.},

A time-dependent cooperative task is a task requiring multiple agents to perform separate sub tasks simultaneously or within some predetermined margin where agent availability to perform a subtask is limited to specific intervals in time. By separating the underlying calculation of agent availability and cost from the mechanism of assignment, a method to solve complex cooperative assignment problems can be formulated.

  pages={24941-24956},
  abstract={UAV surveillance and tracking have attracted great enthusiasm in intelligent transportation, and various approaches have been reported up to now. However, these approaches often ignored the uncertainties in the urban environment, such as occlusion, view change, and background clutter. Ignoring these uncertain factors often leads to a reduction in surveillance performance and tracking quality. This study devotes to improving the cooperative surveillance capability of multi-UAV formation by designing different cooperative strategies in the urban environment. To be specific, a novel cooperative architecture is designed to control the observation locations of multiple UAVs throughout the formation process. For different types of interference, we introduce a novel target recognition rate of each UAV as the decision factor and design corresponding cooperative strategies to guarantee the accuracy of cooperative surveillance. Based on this architecture, we develop a vision-based method of cooperative surveillance and tracking by multiple UAVs (SMART) whose objective function is the motion cost and flight reliability of UAVs to ensure that each UAV can be in the optimal surveillance location for the target. The proposed SMART skillfully integrates the strict, elastic, and flight constraint strategies. During the execution of the multi-UAV formation, the inherent safety constraints of multiple UAVs and the designed strategies are used to solve the quadratic optimization model to adjust the locations of these UAVs. To demonstrate the superiority of our method, we conduct a 3D simulation urban environment and devise several experiments to analyze the performance of SMART on it. The experimental results demonstrate that SMART can not only maintain the high cooperative flight capability, but also provide high flexibility and fault tolerance.},

  abstract={Mine search and rescue unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can replace rescue personnel to quickly enter complex and dangerous post disaster sites, complete environmental detection and personnel search tasks. Cooperative control of UAVs is the key technology of underground search and rescue mobile communication network and blind area search. Starting from the special environment characteristics of the mine and the requirement of multiple UAVs cooperative control, this article studies the cooperative control method of multiple UAVs based on improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. Using improved A* algorithm, the shortest path of obstacle between two track points is planned. The shortest path is used as the input of the global objective function in the task allocation process, and the particle swarm structure corresponding to the coordination system is used to improve the particle swarm optimization task allocation and iterative optimization. The simulation results show that the algorithm can produce reasonable task assignment results and automatic obstacle avoidance route planning control for UAV while guaranteeing the computation speed and convergence performance.},

  abstract={Target tracking is one of the crucial technologies in UAV applications, which has been extensively interested and researched in recent years. To solve the issue that the UAV is susceptible to be disturbed by complex environment when tracking a moving target, resulting in low tracking accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach of cooperative tracking model based on UAVs in the uncertain environment. Specifically, considering that multiple UAVs are affected by various interferences such as obstacles and motion angles during the tracking process, the tracking rate of individual UAV is introduced to design corresponding cooperative rules. Furthermore, we establish a multi-UAV cooperative model with moving displacement as the objective function, and dynamically adjust the observation position of each UAV relative to the target according to different rules to improve the tracking accuracy. Simulation results show that our model has superior tracking accuracy and cooperative efficiency.},

  abstract={The coverage path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a complex optimization problem in practice, especially for those involving multiple target areas. It is challenging to comprehensively plan the inter-area visiting order and the intra-area coverage paths simultaneously. Due to the battery limitation, usually the task can hardly be finished by a single UAV, and instead a fleet of UAVs are required. In this article, we first formulate an energy-aware multi-UAV multi-area coverage path planning (EM$^2$CPP) model, in order to characterize the practical path planning requirements of UAVs in complex conditions. Subsequently, to accomplish the optimization task, we propose a bipartite cooperative coevolution (BiCC) algorithm that coevolves an inter-area path planning and an intra-area path planning components to obtain good solutions. The basic operators in BiCC, such as the initialization and the reproduction operators, are tailored for the task of EM$^2$CPP. Besides, we also develop a fast heuristic algorithm for EM$^2$CPP, which is able to produce approximate solutions in a short time. Simulations on real-world datasets validate the good performance of the proposed methods.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a novel integrated vehicular system using collaborative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for autonomous exploration, mapping, and navigation in GPS-denied 3-dimensional (3-D) unknown environments. The system implements a novel two-layered exploration strategy to decompose the perception task into a coarse exploration layer and a fine mapping layer. The coarse exploration makes use of a UGV to carry out fast autonomous exploration and active 2.5D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to generate a coarse environment model, which serves as a navigation reference for subsequent complementary 3-D fine mapping conducted by a UAV. The two layers share a novel optimized exploration path planning and navigation framework, which provides optimal exploration paths and integrates the collaborative exploration and mapping efforts through an OctoMap-based volumetric motion planning interface. The proposed system provides an efficient pipeline of fast environment perception taking advantages of the agility of the UAVs as well as the powerful computation resource aboard UGVs, also allowing assistive local perception with augmented object information when necessary. The effectiveness of our system is verified by both simulations and experiments, which demonstrate its capability of implementing heterogeneous UAV and UGV collaborative exploration and structural reconstruction of the environments through active SLAM, providing optimized perception for navigation tasks.},

  abstract={To solve the problem of cooperative task reallocation for large-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) team under complex dynamic environment, a method based on man in-loop consensus auction principle is proposed. Firstly, Delaunay diagram is used for environment modeling. Then, the shortest paths of UAVs to targets are obtained by using Warshall-Floyd algorithm, thus task allocation and path planning are decoupled. Finally, with man in-loop and consensus-based auction approach, the task reallocation under several sudden changes of environment is achieved. Simulation results show that, the proposed method can provide a feasible task reallocation in 1.2s for a large-scale UAV team, which proves the real-time performance of this method.},

Another feasible application area for formal techniques is in the modelling and verification of cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) teams. The rationale being, multi-UAV coordination for cooperative control is a time-critical, zero-fault tolerant activity involving dynamic planning and real-time decision making. This provides sufficient incentive for designers to prove that the proposed system architecture works as advertised. In this paper, a simulation scenario involving multiple UAVs for co-ordinated arrival at a specified target using Dubins' curves, is modelled using the Kripke models of "possible worlds". This formal model is then subjected to a proof verification technique known as model checking, for verifying the safety, reachability, etc. This novel framework is sophisticated enough to be reusable, and consequently, be able to address scalability issues.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are remote controlled or autonomous air vehicles. An UAV can be equipped with various types of sensors to perform life rescue missions or it can be armed with weapons to carry out stealthy attack missions. With the unmanned nature of UAVs, a mission can be taken in any hostile environment without risking the life of pilots. Among life rescue missions, the common objective is often defined as maximizing the total coverage area of the UAVs with the limited resources. When the number of UAVs increases, coordination among these UAVs becomes very complicated even for experienced pilots. In this paper, a cooperative path planner for UAVs is proposed. The path of each UAV is represented by a B-spline curve with a number of control points. The positions of these control points are optimized using an ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) such that the total coverage of the UAVs is maximized.},

Recent advances in sensing, communication and computation enable the conduct of cooperative multiple-UAV missions deemed impossible in the recent past. We are interested in solving the Formation Reconfiguration Planning (FRP) problem which is focused on determining a nominal state and input trajectory for each vehicle such that the group can start from the given initial configuration and reach its given final configuration at the specified time while satisfying a set of given inter- and intra- vehicle constraints. Each solution of a FRP problem represents a distinct reconfiguration mode. When coupled with formation keeping modes, they can form a hybrid automaton of formation maneuvers in which a transition from one formation maneuver to another formation maneuver is governed by a finite automaton. This paper focuses on the implementation of the optimized hybrid system approach to formation reconfiguration for a group of 1 real and 3 virtual UAVs. Experimental results performed in the Richmond Field Station by using a helicopter-based Berkeley Aerial Robot are presented.},

  abstract={The cooperative search problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in unknown sea environment is studied. Considering the influence of detection distance on target detection probability, UAV steering and collision avoidance threat, a multi ant colony cooperative search algorithm based on prior information is proposed. Firstly, according to the prior information of target distribution, the probability distribution map of target based on searching region is established. Then, the pheromone concentration is initialized according to the target probability distribution, and the prior information is used to guide various ant colony searches. According to the target probability, the state transition rules are designed to maximize the target discovery probability. Finally, the pheromone concentration is updated according to the advantages and disadvantages of the search path solution, and the effectiveness of the search strategy is verified by simulation.},

  abstract={In the field of aerial photography, UAVs can be used as an ideal carrier of sensors. It is meaningful to plan its coverage path combined with the sensor model. Previous works mainly used decentralized coverage to realize UAV formation cooperative operation, but for the aerial photography scene of a single task, the decentralized coverage algorithm is not effective. In this paper, a centralized coverage algorithm of UAV formation for aerial photography is proposed, which is divided into two sub-problems: coverage path planning and formation control. In the coverage path planning, due to high repetition rate and excessive number of turns of the traditional PRM algorithm, the constraint of the number of turns is introduced, and the back-and-forth mode is used to improve it. In formation control, in order to more accurately evaluate the performance of the coverage path, it refers to the consensus theory and combines the artificial potential field method to guide the reverse-V UAV formation to follow the coverage path. Multi-group simulations show that the proposed algorithm is feasible to implement the concentrated coverage for aerial photography under the comprehensive consideration of path length, number of turns, calculation time, coverage rate and repeating rate.},

  abstract={Efficient aerial data collection is important in many remote sensing applications. In large-scale monitoring scenarios, deploying a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers improved spatial coverage and robustness against individual failures. However, a key challenge is cooperative path planning for the UAVs to efficiently achieve a joint mission goal. We propose a novel multi-agent informative path planning approach based on deep reinforcement learning for adaptive terrain monitoring scenarios using UAV teams. We introduce new network feature representations to effectively learn path planning in a 3D workspace. By leveraging a counterfactual baseline, our approach explicitly addresses credit assignment to learn cooperative behaviour. Our experimental evaluation shows improved planning performance, i.e. maps regions of interest more quickly, with respect to non-counterfactual variants. Results on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art non-learning-based methods, while being transferable to varying team sizes and communication constraints.},

  pages={11727-11740},
  abstract={Coverage path planning (CPP) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) plays a significant role in intelligent distributed surveillance systems. However, due to poor cooperation, most existing CPP methods may cause strongly overlapped trajectories, missing areas, or even collisions in uncertain and complex environments, leading to long task completion time and low coverage efficiency. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel multi-UAV distributed online cooperation (MDOC) CPP method that aims to minimize task completion time. Moreover, this method allows UAVs to quickly respond to unknown obstacles and complex emergencies, such as UAV breakdown or communication interruption. To establish close cooperation between UAVs, we propose an efficient environmental information map (EI-map) fusion technique that enables them to obtain global exploration in real-time in a cooperative manner. Then we innovatively develop a distributed cooperative deep Q-learning (DCDQN) algorithm to obtain UAVs' coverage paths online that are determined by minimizing task time and avoiding overlaps, missing areas, and collisions. Specifically, attributing to the fused EI-map, we expand the state space of DCDQN to collect sufficient observations and design a novel cooperative learning pattern to efficiently plan the path for global optimization. Simulation results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in task completion time and coverage efficiency, especially in uncertain and complex environments. In addition, we validate that our method can efficiently complete full coverage even in emergencies.},

  abstract={Cooperation between Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in carrying out persistent monitoring tasks have advantages such as agility in motion, wide coverage, and high efficiency. In complex environments, the status of task points is constantly changing. A single UAV or UGV cannot flexibly adjust its monitoring strategy to prevent intruder and cannot quickly and efficiently deal with abnormal situations at task points. The cooperation of multiple UAV sand UGVs have higher efficiency and can maintain the monitoring targets in a timely manner. This paper establishes a cooperative path planning model for multiple UAVs and UGVs to address these issues. The persistent monitoring tasks are formulated by minimizing the maximum risk coefficient of monitoring assignments, and a rolling optimization path planning model is established. A combination of genetic algorithms and ant colony algorithms is used to obtain the path. Simulation experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper is not only effective, but also has a fast convergence rate and meets the requirement of privacy protection in adversarial environment.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networking and collaboration have significant prospects in both civilian and military applications, due to its remarkable properties in cooperative efficiency, reduced risks, and operational cost. Traditional algorithms have challenging issues of high computational complexity and low efficiency in UAV swarm networking and collaboration, while computational intelligence (CI) has attracted increasing attention since it has advantages in solving complex optimization problems. The networking of UAV swarms serves as an essential foundation for collaboration, and intelligent collaboration is a crucial means of enhancing the performance of UAV swarm systems. To date, extensive CI-based algorithms have been proposed to improve the networking and collaboration capabilities of UAV swarms, and several relevant surveys have also been presented. However, existing surveys either review networking or collaboration. To the best of our knowledge, there is no survey that simultaneously concentrates on CI-based UAV swarm networking and collaboration. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of CI-based networking and collaboration algorithms from six typical aspects including channel access, network routing, cooperative task assignment, cooperative path planning, cooperative search, and cooperative jamming. More importantly, to help researchers choose appropriate algorithms to satisfy the requirements of different missions, we classify CI-based algorithms into four categories, namely heuristic behavior search-based algorithms, policy design-based algorithms, policy learning-based algorithms, and hybrid algorithms. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions that may influence future research on UAV swarm intelligence networking and collaboration. This review may provide new insights and valuable references for researchers in this field.},

  abstract={A small group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), each equipped with a communications payload, offers a possible means of providing broadband services over disaster regions. The UAVs are power limited so the number of mobile sub-scribers that can be supported by each UAV depends on its proximity to clusters of mobiles. One way of maximising the total number of mobiles supported within the available RF power is to periodically relocate each of the UAVs in response to the movement of the mobiles. This paper compares two approaches for optimally locating the UAVs. One approach employs a non cooperative game (NCG) as the mechanism to plan the next flying strategies for the group. The other uses evolutionary algorithms (EA) to evolve flying manoeuvres in a collaborative manner. Exemplar comparison results show that although both approaches are able to provide sufficient network coverage adaptively, they exhibit different flying behaviours in terms of flightpath, separation and convergence time. The non cooperative game is found to fly all aerial vehicles in a similar, balanced and conservative way, whilst the evolutionary algorithms enable the emergence of flexible and specialised flying behaviours for each member in the flying group which converge faster to a sufficient global solution.},

  abstract={Fast-moving unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), serving as a messenger to visit ground vehicles (GVs) for information relays, can be applied to complex tasks in urban environments, such as air-ground cooperative urban rescue and UAV-assisted data collection. Existing work ensures that the UAV visits all GVs by assuming that it knows the motion parameters of GVs (e.g., velocities or paths) at any given time. However, in practice, GVs may not move with anticipated velocities due to motion uncertainties. This UAV path planning problem can be formulated as a Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Uncertain Neighborhoods (DDTSPUN). The problem involves variables with complex interdependencies (e.g., the visiting sequence of the UAV to GVs and the access location of the UAV to GVs) and requires solving a sequence of uncertain encounter problems. To address the uncertainty in GV motion, we define robust neighborhoods and corridors and prove that the UAV can revisit GVs reliably by visiting these areas. By flying the UAV through robust areas, the DDTSPUN can be transformed into a deterministic optimization problem, namely Revisit-time-constrained Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood (RDTSPN), which provides a simplified model and compresses the solution space. To address the RDTSPN, we propose an online heuristic path planning algorithm. It incorporates a gradient-based method for visiting robust neighborhoods and a sampling-based search strategy along robust corridors to obtain the Dubins paths of the UAV that achieve robust visit for each GV. Finally, the computational experiments, including representative instances, random instances with different scales, and an instance generated using real-world data, demonstrate its advantages over other state-of-the-art algorithms in obtaining the shortest path that satisfies UAV curvature constraints while ensuring robust access to all GVs.},

  abstract={In the dynamical environment with forbidden areas, the achievement of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) executing cooperative missions strongly depends on the validity of mission planning results, which may be affected by the error of flight time estimation. In this paper, a hierarchical path generation scheme for improving the adaptability and performance of the distributed mission planning (DMP) system of the UAVs is proposed. The effectiveness of the market-based task allocation is enhanced by conducting a rough path planning beforehand, where only the neighboring forbidden areas of the vehicles are considered for a tradeoff between the planning accuracy and the computation. The subsequent refined path planning, which provides the guidance information to the control system, is also presented to assess the precision level of the rough path planning and the mission execution reward of the UAV fleet. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method for multiple UAVs executing missions in stochastic scenarios.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to be extensively employed for assisting wireless communications in the Internet of Things (IoT). On the other hand, terahertz (THz)-enabled intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is expected to be one of the core enabling technologies for forthcoming beyond-5G (B5G) wireless communications that promise a broad range of data-demand applications. In this article, we propose a UAV-mounted IRS (UIRS) communication system over THz bands for confidential data dissemination from an access point (AP) toward multiple ground user equipments (UEs) in IoT networks. Specifically, the AP intends to send data to the scheduled UE, while unscheduled UEs may behave as potential adversaries. To protect information messages from the privacy preservation perspective, we aim to devise an energy-efficient multi-UAV covert communication scheme, where the UIRS is for reliable data transmissions, and an extra UAV is utilized as an aerial cooperative jammer, opportunistically generating artificial noise (AN) to degrade unscheduled UEs detection, leading to communication covertness improvement. This poses a novel max-min optimization problem in terms of minimum average energy efficiency (mAEE), aiming to improve covert throughput and reduce UAVs’ propulsion energy consumption, subject to satisfying some practical constraints such as the covertness requirements for which we obtain analytical expressions. Since the optimization problem is nonconvex, we tackle it via the block successive convex approximation (BSCA) approach to iteratively solve a sequence of approximated convex subproblems, designing the binary user scheduling, AP’s power allocation, maximum AN jamming power, IRS beamforming, and both UAVs’ trajectory and velocity planning. Finally, we present a low-complex overall algorithm for system performance enhancement with complexity and convergence analysis. Numerical results are provided to verify the analysis and demonstrate significant outperformance of our design over other existing benchmark schemes concerning the mAEE performance.},

  pages={153-160},
  abstract={Robot Operating System (ROS) has proven itself as a viable framework for developing robot-related applications. It offers features such as hardware abstraction, low-level device support, inter-process communication, and useful libraries for autonomous robot systems. Concerning aerial robots, commonly called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones, ROS provides unfortunately very basic functions. Moreover, it does not guarantee real-time operation, as it runs under Linux. Consequently, it is difficult to implement advanced ROS applications that involve a swarm of drones that need to communicate with each other to carry out a common mission. This paper proposes an extended version of the ROS framework called autotarget*, which provides a set of efficient functions designed for distributed operation on multiple UAVs flying at the same time. autotarget* relies on a multi-tier architecture with a decentralized communication layer, enabling intra-UAV messaging as well as the scalability of swarm UAVs. It has a set of daemons whose feature is to regulate the swarm's consensus control and failover policy to ensure convergence towards a common goal. Experiments with real-world swarms revealed that autotarget* is portable and satisfies the performance requirements for collaborative mission applications. We further conducted a coverage planning mission using the parallel back-and-forth algorithm, which demonstrated the efficiency of the framework in terms of time and energy. Our work should pave the way for an open-source environment dedicated to simplifying collaborative ROS application development, particularly for multi-UAV systems.},

  abstract={Deployment of the unarmed aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm promises increased efficiency and safety of area search coverage. Multiple UAVs must be capable of autonomous collaboration and area search coverage for this. Therefore, we integrate multi-agent reinforcement learning into the cooperative control method of UAV swarm and propose a decentralized cooperative control for networked multiple UAVs technique based on the extended-proximal policy optimization algorithm (EPPO). The proposed approach not only adopts distributed training for multiple agents, but also allows them to obtain some mutual state information, such as position information and searched sub-areas. So, it can significantly speed up training and increase the effectiveness and safety of task completion in real-world applications. After a simulation, the multi-intelligent UAV can rapidly cover 100% of the mission area and ensure more excellent safety.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the problem of extending the flight duration of cooperative missions with multiple gliding fixed-wing UAVs by using the energy that comes from static soaring. We consider exploration missions where UAVs should pass through a set of Point of Interest (PoI) with the presence of thermals in the space. These thermals can be exploited to provide energy in terms of altitude for each gliding UAV. The objective of the mission is to extend the flight duration of each UAV to explore the environment without landing and decreasing the time to perform the mission. An algorithm named Bounded Recursive Heuristic Search (BRHS), based on Depth-First search techniques, is applied to the PoIs and to the UAVs. The main advantage is the real time application because of the low computational load. The paper presents a set of simulations and experiments have carried out in the airfield of La Cartuja (Seville, Spain).},

  abstract={A path planning and control method based on adaptive potential functions is presented for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard sensors, and deployed to search and classify multiple targets. The proposed method plans the motion of the UAVs to support a primary sensing objective that, in this case, is to maximize the classification performance of the sensor measurements gathered by the UAVs over time. An adaptive potential function approach originally developed for ground robots is modified and employed as a guidance law for a class of rotary-wing UAVs that must also avoid obstacles located in a three-dimensional workspace. The simulation results show that, by this approach, a single UAV is capable of visiting targets that offer the best tradeoff between distance and measurement information value. Furthermore, simulations involving multiple UAVs deployed to classify the same set of targets show that, by this approach, there emerge a cooperative behavior by which the UAVs can react, as a group, to the targets' classification uncertainties.},

  abstract={Frequent updates concerning the progress of a forest fire are essential for effective and safe fire fighting. Since a forest fire is typically inaccessible by ground vehicles due to mountainous terrain, small unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a promising means of monitoring large forest fires. We present an effective UAV path planning algorithm utilizing infrared images that are collected on-board in real-time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our path planning algorithm in realistic scenarios, we simulated the propagation of a forest fire with the EMBYR model. A new cooperative control mission concept is introduced where multiple low-altitude, short-endurance (LASE) UAVs are used for fire monitoring. By employing multiple UAVs, the effectiveness of the mission in terms of information update rate can be improved dramatically.},

  abstract={The overall aim of the ROSM project is the implementation of an innovative solution based on heterogeneous autonomous vehicles to tackle maritime pollution (in particular, oil spills). These solutions will be based on native microbial consortia with bioremediation capacity, and the adaptation of air and surface autonomous vehicles for in-situ release of autochthonous microorganisms (bioaugmentation) and nutrients (biostimulation). By doing so, these systems can be used as the first line of the responder to pollution incidents from several origins that may occur inside ports, around industrial and extraction facilities, or during transport activities, in a fast, efficient and low-cost way. The paper will address the development of a team of autonomous vehicles able to carry, as payload, native organisms to naturally degrade oil spills (avoiding the introduction of additional chemical or biological additives), the development of a multi-robot system able to provide a first line responses to oil spill incidents under unfavourable and harsh conditions with low human intervention, and then a decentralized cooperative planning with the ability to coordinate an efficient oil spill combat. Field tests have been performed in Leixões Harbour in Porto and Medas, Portugal, with a simulated oil spill and validated the decentralized coordinated task between the autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) ROAZ and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).},

  abstract={This paper presents the moving targets fast search method with multiple UAVs cooperative searching. In order to decrease the search duration and improve the search efficiency of moving targets, the dynamic and time-sensitive key area model is formulated according to the target probability map by just searching the key areas instead of searching whole mission area. On this basis, these key areas are allocated to different UAVs and the moving targets searching problem is modeled as the dynamic coupled traveling salesman problem (DC-TSP). The coupled solution framework consisting of the task allocation layer and the path planning layer is designed to solve this problem, where the former confirms the number of tasks and execution order for each UAV to sequential search the key areas using an opposition-based genetic algorithm with the elite strategy, and the latter solves the search path for the UAV to execute its search tasks using depth first search with the receding horizon optimization. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that FSM proposed can significantly reduce the mission duration and find the all moving targets in mission area, outperforming than distributed ant colony optimization and genetic algorithm.},

  abstract={In order to solve the problem of distributed cooperative jamming task allocation of UAV swarm, an optimal allocation method based on improving the cover efficiency of manned aircraft is proposed. Firstly, based on the cooperative interference of multiple UAVs, a model of common detection exposure area of networked radar is established.Then, according to the concept of safety zone in the jamming effectiveness evaluation criterion, a more objective and comprehensive jamming evaluation function model is established by combining the shortest distance between the manned aircraft and the exposed area boundary, the feasible area range for the manned aircraft to plan the safe track in the next step and the degree of suppression of the radar exposed area.

  abstract={Modern advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have widened the scope of commercial and military applications. However, the increased dependency on wireless communications exposes UAVs to potential attacks and introduces new threats, especially from UAVs designed with the malicious intent of targeting vital infrastructures. Significant efforts have been made from researchers and other United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) agencies for developing countermeasures for detection, interception, or destruction of the malicious UAVs. One promising countermeasure is the use of a counter UAV (CUAV) swarm to detect, track, and neutralize the malicious UAV. This article aims to recognize the state-of-the-art swarm intelligence algorithms for achieving cooperative capture of a mobile target UAV. The major design and implementation challenges for swarm control, algorithm architecture, and safety protocols are considered. A prime challenge for UAV swarms is a robust communication infrastructure to enable accurate data transfer between UAVs for efficient path planning. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach is applied to train a group of CUAVs to intercept a faster malicious UAV, while avoiding collisions among other CUAVs and non-cooperating obstacles (i.e., other aerial objects maneuvering in the area). The impact of the latency incurred through UAV-to-UAV communications is showcased and discussed with preliminary numerical results.},

  abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be applied to planetary surface exploration due to the advantages of large coverage areas, low cost, and all-time monitoring. However, obtaining sensor data stably and efficiently is difficult due to energy constraints and environmental interference. In this paper, we propose Swarm-Re, including hierarchical heterogeneous opportunistic routing (HHOR) for cooperative air-ground network communication and fast terrain exploration algorithm to collect information efficiently. The sensor nodes are clustered by the DBSCAN algorithm based on the estimated SNR and network connectivity. For cross-cluster communication, HHOR deploys UAV nodes to achieve obstacle crossing. Through the experiment of Swarm-RE, HHOR consumes the least energy and accomplishes a high data delivery rate compared with representative routing protocols. The HHOR protocol shows the lowest expected end-to-end delay and highest channel utilization in both intra-cluster and cross-cluster communications. Relying on HHOR and UAV deployment, the Fast exploration algorithm can improve the efficiency with an average of 11s per Number of UAV. The result shows that the Swarm-RE provides efficient routine and exploration ability in planetary surface.},

In this study we focus on the problem of uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs) searching for targets in an uncertain environment We have previously presented a model-based decision-making and task-allocation methodology for this problem. In this paper, we investigate how the choice of two critically important parameters in the algorithm influence the performance of the UAV team. We evaluate the effect of these parameters on six different performance measures: 1) total mission time; 2) classification error rate; 3) target neutralization time; 4) task attempt times; 5) target miss ratio; and 6) task-driven traveling distance. The results provide valuable intuition on the selection of system design parameters based on different mission requirements},

In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for multi-UAV path planning that considers a cooperative action amongst UAVs in which they share the next destination to avoid visiting the same location at the same time. The Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN) enables UAVs to autonomously plan their fastest path and ensure the continuity of the mission by deciding when to schedule a visit to a charging station or a data collection point. An objective function with a tailored reward is designed to maintain the stability of the model and ensure the quick convergence of the model. Lastly, the proposed strategy has been demonstrated by the experiments on different scenarios and showed its effectiveness in ensuring the continuity of the mission with a fastest path possible.},

  abstract={Collaboration of agents in a natural swarm enables the accomplishment of tasks that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent to complete alone. For example, a swarm of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) enables the collaborative sensing of bulky loads for transportation over impassable terrains when the load weighs several times more than each UAV. In this work, we propose a hierarchical algorithmic architecture that supports the search and coverage of various unknown payload profiles for subsequent transportation. The grasping formation of UAVs over the payload emerges from the synthetic behaviours in the architecture without any path planning. Experiments show that our proposed design can be successfully applied in searching and coverage of various loads and has been validated in the real world through the use of Crazyflie micro-UAVs. Furthermore, the proposed grasping formation satisfies static equilibrium thereby reducing orientation changes in the load-swarm system during transportation.},

  year={2022},

  abstract={This article proposes a method for the cooperative control of two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to guarantee collision avoidance. The UAVs are locally controlled and are able to change their trajectories at any time. They are connected over an unreliable communication network that may induce packet losses and transmission delays. The network has no coordinator and necessary information for collision avoidance can solely be communicated. In order to reduce the communication effort, information are only transmitted at discrete time instants when they are necessary. Depending on the current situation, one UAV is responsible for avoiding the collision by adjusting its trajectory. To this aim, a control unit is introduced for the UAVs that uses the idea of event-based control and combines methods from communication technology and control theory. The control unit has to execute four tasks: estimation of the current network properties, prediction of the movement of the neighboring object, invocation of communication in an event-based fashion, and planning of the collision avoiding trajectory. It is proved that the control aims are satisfied even in the presence of time delays and packet losses induced by the communication network. A simulation study with two quadrotors shows the suitability of the method.},

  abstract={Unmanned ground and aerial vehicles are becoming crucial to many applications because of their ability to assist humans in carrying out dangerous missions. These vehicles can be viewed as networks of heterogeneous unmanned robotic sensors with the goal of exploring complex environments, to search for and, possibly, pursue moving targets. The robotic vehicle performance can be greatly enhanced by implementing future sensor actions intelligently, based both on prior knowledge and on the information obtained by the sensors on line. In this paper, we present an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to cooperative navigation for heterogeneous sensor networks. The mobile sensor network consists of a set of robotic sensors modeled as hybrid systems with processing capabilities. The goal of the ADP algorithm is to coordinate a team of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles (i.e., ground robot and quadrotor UAV) to navigate within an obstacle populated environment while satisfying collision avoidance constraints and searching for stationary and mobile targets. It is assumed that the ground vehicle has a small sensor footprint with high resolution. The quadrotor, on the other hand, has a large sensor field-of-view but low resolution. The UAV provides a low resolution look-ahead map to the ground robot which in turn uses this information to plan its actions. The proposed navigation strategy combines artificial potential functions for target pursuing with ADP for learning C-obstacles on line. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is verified through numerical simulations.},

  pages={499-519},
  abstract={Perching on the moving platforms is a promising solution to enhance the endurance and operational range of quadrotors, which could benefit the efficiency of a variety of air ground cooperative tasks. To ensure robust perching, tracking with a steady relative state and reliable perception is a prerequisite. This paper presents an adaptive dynamic tracking and perching scheme for autonomous quadrotors to achieve tight integration with moving platforms. For reliable perception of dynamic targets, we introduce elastic visibility aware planning to actively avoid occlusion and target loss. Additionally, we propose a flexible terminal adjustment method that adapts the changes in flight duration and the couple d terminal states, ensuring full state synchronization with the time varying perching surface at various angles. A relaxation strategy is developed by optimizing the tangential relative speed to address the dynamics and safety violations brought by hard bo undary conditions. Moreover, we take SE(3) motion planning into account to ensure no collision until the contact moment. Furthermore, we propose an efficient spatiotemporal trajectory optimization framework considerin g full state dynamics The proposed method is extensively tested through benchmark comparisons and ablation studies. To facilitate the application of academic research to industry and to validate the efficiency under strictly limited computational resources, we deploy our system on a commercial drone (DJI MAVIC3) with a full size sport utility vehicle (SUV). We conduct extensive real world experiments, where the drone successfully tracks and perches at 30 km/h (8.3 m/ s) on the top of the SUV, and at 3.5∼m/s with 60° inclined into the trunk of the SUV.},

The UAV swarm system, which refers to a cooperative formation of UAVs that conduct exploration and mapping activities in a synergistic mode, is part of the most well-known new scenarios that have been introduced in recent years. A significant challenge of such systems is determining the kind of UAV swarm architecture that will enable increased efficiency and resilience in operations.

  abstract={This paper studies the cooperative hunting problem, where a group of agents encircle a target while avoiding collisions with each other and with obstacles in the environment. The paper deals with obstacle rich environments and dynamic (moving obstacle) environments by formulating the problem as both a control problem and a planning problem. A model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed which integrates a multi-agent planner with the cooperative hunting objective while also accounting for UAV dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through a comparative analysis with optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), and then validated through experiments with quadrotor UAVs. Using the proposed method, agents no longer get stuck in local minima for obstacle rich environments and capture the target faster with shorter trajectories in moving obstacle environments.},

  abstract={Cooperative load carrying is an area of multi-agent systems that has extensive potential applications. Though most of the complexities involved with multi-agent operations have been investigated in general swarm operations, the greatest challenge of heavy duty aerial transportation that has yet to be addressed is the limited control authority of the system as a whole as each individual agent, and hence effector, is typically significantly smaller than the payload. Based on the configuration whereby the vehicles are connected rigidly to the load, we present a general optimisation method to find the most effective team arrangement that will maximise the control authority within the physical constraints of the system. Additionally, each UAV is allowed to tilt laterally at a fixed angle relative to the payload, which provides a larger maximum rotational acceleration achievable about the yaw axis. The optimised solution, implementation and results based on the cooperative carrying task in the 2017 International Micro Air Vehicles Competition is presented in this paper. Testing results show that the system designed is effective in transporting the payload autonomously according to generated trajectories.},

  abstract={With the increasing number of maritime trade activities, carrying out rapid and effective maritime search and rescue operation has become an urgent need for research in order to ensure the safety of navigation at sea. Now, we mainly rely on artificial decision making, artificial distribution of search and rescue area, and artificial driving ship to complete search and rescue operation. The distribution, synergy, parallelism, robustness and intelligence of unmanned boat and UAV provide a new idea for the development of search and rescue work at sea. The marine search and rescue system under the new situation can be regarded as a hierarchical control network system composed of multi agents. And in this paper, a new fast search and rescue system is proposed by using the improved ant colony algorithm and the independent calculation decision of the agents. The system adopts the edge computing, relies on the information sharing and the cooperative decision between the search and rescue agent groups. And finally it achieves the independent synchronous search and rescue. Distributed task allocation solutions break through the limitations of centralized hierarchical task allocation based on manpower. Edge computing requires all distributed control nodes to make autonomous decisions in the task process. Based on the distributed cluster control of unmanned boat and UAVs, this paper combines edge computing, cooperative communication, centralized task allocation and decision making together.},

  abstract={Instant delivery has become a fundamental service in people's daily lives. Different from the traditional express service, the instant delivery has a strict shipping time constraint after being ordered. However, the labor shortage makes it challenging to realize efficient instant delivery. To tackle the problem, researchers have studied to introduce vehicles (i.e., taxis) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) into instant delivery tasks. Unfortunately, the delivery detour of taxis and the limited battery of UAVs make it hard to meet the rapidly increasing instant delivery demands. Under this circumstance, this paper proposes an air-ground cooperative instant delivery paradigm to maximize the delivery performance and meanwhile minimize the negative effects on the taxi passengers. Specifically, a data-driven delivery potential-demands-aware cooperative strategy is designed to improve the overall delivery performance of both UAVs and taxis as well as the taxi passengers' experience. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the delivery number by 30.1% and 114.5% compared to the taxi-based and UAV-based instant delivery respectively, and shortens the delivery time by 35.7% compared to the taxi-based instant delivery.},

  abstract={Implicit neural representations have shown promising potential for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent work applies it to autonomous 3D reconstruction by learning information gain for view path planning. Effective as it is, the computation of the information gain is expensive, and compared with that using volumetric representations, collision checking using the implicit representation for a 3D point is much slower. In the paper, we propose to 1) leverage a neural network as an implicit function approximator for the information gain field and 2) combine the implicit fine-grained representation with coarse volumetric representations to improve efficiency. Further with the improved efficiency, we propose a novel informative path planning based on a graph-based planner. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in the reconstruction quality and planning efficiency compared with autonomous reconstructions with implicit and explicit representations. We deploy the method on a real UAV and the results show that our method can plan informative views and reconstruct a scene with high quality.},

  abstract={In multi-target tracking, sensor control involves dynamically configuring sensors to achieve improved tracking performance. Many of these techniques focus on sensors with memoryless states (e.g., waveform adaptation, beam scheduling, and sensor selection), lending themselves to computationally efficient control strategies. Mobile sensor control for multi-target tracking, however, is significantly more challenging due to the complexity of the platform state dynamics. This platform complexity necessitates high-fidelity, non-myopic control strategies in order to achieve strong tracking performance while maintaining safe operation. These sensor control techniques are particularly important in non-cooperative urban surveillance applications including person of interest, vehicle, and unauthorized UAV interdiction. In this overview paper, we highlight the current state of the art in mobile sensor control for multi-target tracking in urban environments. We use this application to motivate the need for closer collaboration between the information fusion, tracking, and control research communities across three challenge areas relevant to the urban surveillance problem.},

Achieving such a degree of control and producing such sophisticated behavior remains an elusive goal that presents considerable challenges due to the inherent complexity of the task, and also because it may be approached from a variety of different angles. In this paper we present a possible solution to this problem that is based on the idea of surrogate optimization to adaptively identify a terrain map on-line and use it to produce decentralized controllers yielding UAV trajectories in a coordinated manner. Our results indicate that the approach results in a feasible method yielding significantly better results than exhaustive search and random search, which we use as baselines for comparison.},

The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results from extensive Gazebo-based simulations that closely replicate real-world inspection scenarios, highlighting its ability to thoroughly inspect real-world-like 3D structures.},

  abstract={The development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is one of the driving forces for revolutionizing wireless communications in the modern era. Although there are many unique features of UAV networks, their widespread use is still hampered by the short battery life. As a result, most of the research efforts in this domain mainly have focused on the efficient use of energy through trajectory planning and cooperative communication. While there have been a few proposals to use energy harvesting techniques for UAV networks, a complete understanding of the performance limits of such networks is still missing in the literature and needs further investigations. Within this context, our paper provides a comprehensive performance evaluation of UAV relay networks (UAVRNs) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, a cooperative communication system, where a UAV serves as a mobile relay, is fully considered. The UAV relay is considered to be wirelessly-powered and harvests energy from the radio signals received from a nearby base station. For the sake of comparison, both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols are considered. Subsequently, the closed-form expressions of outage probabilities and ergodic capacities are provided for each UAV relaying protocol. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions. The results provided in this work characterize the outage and ergodic capacity performance of NOMA-enabled UAVRNs.},

  abstract={This study establishes a UAV cluster path search model based on the Gray Wolf optimization algorithm. First, to meet the scenario of multi-UAV cooperative planning, the traditional binary coding method cannot accurately encode the high-dimensional, multi-constraint cooperative trajectory planning problem, so the variable length coding method is used to encode it. The optimized numerical intelligences with variable length coding method are used to represent the multi-UAV cooperative trajectory, which reduces the amount of searching operations of the GWO algorithm and improves the efficiency of the optimization searching; at the same time, this study establishes and examines innovative mathematical models in a large number of ways, and achieves the fast optimization searching of the algorithms at the early stage and the deep-mining and fast searching of the algorithms at the later stage by searching for the function factor of the update matrix in the nonlinear way. Finally, this study improves the optimization of the GWO algorithms by improving the existing flight control system to make it more suitable for the algorithms and engineering requirements of the UAV intelligent delivery task. And at the same time, the algorithms have also realized the experimental operation of the flight control system and the robustness verification of the algorithms in the actual scenarios. The improved algorithm takes 622 seconds, has no collisions, and the convergence value of the fitness function is 29.26.},

  abstract={We present a viewpoint-based non-linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) for evacuation guiding robots. Specifically, the proposed MPC algorithm enables evacuation guiding robots to track and guide cooperative human targets in emergency scenarios. Our algorithm accounts for the environment layout as well as distances between the robot and human target and distance to the goal location. A key challenge for evacuation guiding robot is the trade-off between its planned motion for leading the target toward a goal position and staying in the target’s viewpoint while maintaining line-of-sight for guiding. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed evacuation guiding algorithm in both simulated and real-world environments with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) guiding a human. Our results suggest that using the contextual information from the environment for motion planning, increases the visibility of the guiding UAV to the human while achieving faster total evacuation time.},

  abstract={The planning and operational hierarchy in future combat systems that involve unmanned aerial vehicles will very likely consist of three levels: a team composition and tasking (TCT) level, a team dynamics and tactics (TDT) level, and a cooperative path planning (CPP) level. In this paper, we discuss a game theoretic approach for the target assignment problem at the TDT level. This problem considers the issue of assigning tasks to individual UAVs which could involve attacking one or more fighting units on the other side. The approach considered in this paper involves estimating the reaction of the other side for every possible UAV target assignment that could be made and calculating the resulting Nash equilibrium solution. We discuss an algorithm for determining the Nash solution which overcomes issues related to scalability and is capable of handling target assignments with a large number of non-homogeneous units on each side. In this paper, we discuss both the open-loop and feedback implementations off this algorithm and present simulation results that can be used to assess their performance. Our simulation results show that the availability of sensor information on target damage, as the battle progresses, will allow the feedback implementation at the TDT level to optimally allocate the available UAV resources by avoiding the assignment of tasks that have already been satisfactorily accomplished, either fully or partially. We also introduce the concept of distance discount factor (DDF) to address the fact that targeting close but less significant targets could be more rewarding than targeting far but more significant units. We discuss and compare the results of the feedback implementation with and without DDF.},

  abstract={This paper implements robust decentralized model predictive control (DMPC) for a team of cooperating uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs). The problem involves vehicles with independent dynamics but with coupled constraints to capture required cooperative behavior. Using a recently-developed form of DMPC, each vehicle plans only for its own actions, but feasibility of the sub-problems and satisfaction of the coupling constraints are guaranteed throughout, despite the action of unknown but bounded disturbances. UAVs communicate relevant plan data to ensure that decisions are consistent across the team. Collision avoidance is used as an example of coupled constraints and the paper shows how the speed, turn rate and avoidance distance limits in the optimization should be modified in order to guarantee robust constraint satisfaction. Integer programming is used to solve the non-convex problem of path-planning subject to avoidance constraints. Numerical simulations compare computation time and target arrival time under decentralized and centralized control and investigate the impact of decentralization on team performance. The results show that the computation required for DMPC is significantly lower than for its centralized counterpart and scales better with the size of the team, at the expense of only a small increase in UAV flight times.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the problem of cooperative path planning for a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The paths are optimized to account for uncertainty/adversaries in the environment by modeling the probability of UAV loss. The approach extends prior work by coupling the failure probabilities for each UAV to the selected missions for all other UAVs. In order to maximize the expected mission score, this stochastic formulation designs coordination plans that optimally exploit the coupling effects of cooperation between UAVs to improve survival probabilities. This allocation is shown to recover real-world air operations planning strategies, and to provide significant improvements over approaches that do not correctly account for UAV attrition. The algorithm is implemented in an approximate decomposition approach that uses straight-line paths to estimate the time-of-flight and risk for each mission. The task allocation for the UAVs is then posed as a mixed-integer linear program that can be solved using CPLEX.},

  abstract={UAV cooperative formation provides rescue and material delivery for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). To solve issues, such as low material distribution efficiency and poor mobility during disaster rescue, we propose a two-layer optimization mechanism-based multiple UAV dynamic task planning method (DAWN), which can cope with the problem of the global communication link unreachable caused by disasters. Specifically, we consider the global task allocation as a dynamic vehicle routing problem (VRP) and use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve it so as to minimize the global flight path and energy consumption. Second, based on the current communication structure, we establish a local path planning approach based on the trust network that maximizes the regional coverage rate while minimizing the flight paths. On the basis of these two layers, an UAV formation dynamic task planning approach is realized. Experimental results prove that the proposed DAWN can obtain the optimal flight paths and achieve higher energy efficiency while providing reasonable region coverage to discover more potential tasks.},

  abstract={Technological advances in ad hoc networking and the miniaturization of electromechanical systems are making possible the use of large numbers of mobile agents (for example, mobile robots, human agents, and unmanned vehicles) to perform surveillance, search and rescue, transport, and delivery tasks in aerial, underwater, space, and land environments. However, the successful execution of such tasks often hinges upon accurate position information, which is needed in lower-level locomotion and path-planning algorithms. Common techniques for the localization of mobile robots are the classical preinstalled beacon-based localization algorithms, fixed feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms, and Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation. However, these localization techniques work based on assumptions such as the existence of distinct and static features that can be revisited often or line of sight to GPS satellites, which may not be feasible for operations such as search and rescue, environment monitoring, and oceanic exploration. In the case of GPS navigation, there is also a current concern about signal jamming for outdoor navigation, especially for unmanned aerial vehicle coordination and control. Instead, cooperative localization is emerging as an alternative localization technique that can be employed in such scenarios.},

  abstract={Efficient mission planning, including task allocation and path planning, is crucial for the successful operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in complex scenarios. This article introduces an innovative mission planning approach that employs a collaborative model combining graph neural networks (GNNs) and Transformers to meet the intricate requirements of coordinating UAVs and CAVs. Our model excels in dynamic task allocation and accurate path planning, thereby boosting operational efficiency and reducing computational demands. We outline the shortcomings of current methods, notably their limited adaptability to dynamic changes and their substantial computational costs. By utilizing GNNs to capture complex interrelations and Transformers for effective information processing, our approach achieves greater adaptability and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses leading methods, showing a 12% improvement in task allocation accuracy for UAVs and 10% for CAVs. Furthermore, we assess the model’s performance under various conditions, confirming its robustness and adaptability. This research provides a holistic solution for mission planning in UAV and CAV systems, setting the stage for future enhancements in autonomous vehicle coordination across logistics, surveillance, and disaster management sectors.},

  abstract={This paper studies the problem of using multiple unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to search for moving targets with sensing capabilities. When multiple UAVs (multi-UAV) search for a number of moving targets in the mission area, the targets can intermittently obtain the position information of the UAVs from sensing devices, and take appropriate actions to increase the distance between themselves and the UAVs. Aiming at this problem, an environment model is established using the search map, and the updating method of the search map is extended by considering the sensing capabilities of the moving targets. A multi-UAV search path planning optimization model based on the model predictive control (MPC) method is constructed, and a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm with a crossover operator is designed to solve the model. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the cooperative search efficiency and can find more targets per unit time compared with the coverage search method and the random search method.},

  abstract={A cooperative search and track algorithm for surveilling multiple road vehicles is presented for fixed-wing Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) with a finite field of view. The road network is formed into a graph with nodes that indicate the target likelihood ratio (before detection) and position probability (after detection). Target measurement data is associated to either the likelihood ratio tracker or a Bayesian target tracker. Data association uses a similarity score generated by finding the earth mover's distance between the measurement and track probabilities. Two strategies for motion-planning of UAVs balance searching for new targets and tracking known targets. The first strategy is to loiter over the peak track probability to maximize information about a known target. The second strategy is to continue searching for new targets, returning to known targets only when the peak track probability becomes low. Results from numerical simulations are included to illustrate the performance of the algorithm and to quantify algorithm performance under the influence of added uncertainty in the detection and measurement of targets.},

To reduce repeated exploration, we develop a mission-based protocol that drives robots to share collected information in stable rendezvous. We also design a complete path planning scheme for both centralized and decentralized cases.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a rapid development over the last decade. However, an increasing number of severe flight collision events caused by explosive growth of UAV have drawn widespread concern. It is an important issue to investigate safety management approaches of UAVs to ensure safe and efficient operation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of safety management approaches in large, middle and small scales. In large-scale safety management, path-planning problem is a crucial issue to ensure safety and ordered operation of UAVs globally. In middle-scale safety management, it is an important issue to study the conflict detection and resolution methods. And in small-scale safety management, real-time collision avoidance is the last line of ensuring safety. Moreover, a UAV can be regarded as a terminal device connected through communication and information network. Therefore, the enabling technologies, such as sensing, command and control communication, and collaborative decision-making control technology, have been studied in the last.},
