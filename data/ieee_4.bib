  abstract={In this paper, we study the automatic ground map building and efficient path planning in unmanned aerial/ground vehicle (UAV/UGV) cooperative systems. Using the UAV, a ground image can be obtained from the aerial vision, which is then processed with image denoising, image correction, and obstacle recognition to construct the ground map automatically. Image correction is used to help the UGV improve the recognition accuracy of obstacles. Based on the constructed ground map, a hybrid path planning algorithm is proposed to optimize the planned path. A genetic algorithm is used for global path planning, and a local rolling optimization is used to constantly optimize the results of the genetic algorithm. Experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach can obtain a much less costly path compared to the traditional path planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm and the A-star algorithm and can run in real-time to support the UAV/UGV systems.},

  abstract={Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is a highly trending technology which occupies lots of applications of intelligent communications in day to day life. Typically, vehicles in a vehicular network move at rapid speeds with unpredictable mobility, leading to frequent changes in the network’s structure. Consequently, this might cause some problems while transmitting data between vehicles. In addition, external activities might lead to data loss. In order to overcome certain drawbacks in recent times ground level to air level data connectivity is concentrated which includes the concept of Unmanned Aerial Networks (UAV). The primary obstacles in the construction of UAV is that its network formation and path finding process. For the purpose of overcoming these kinds of drawbacks in this article effective UAV path planning and the energy optimization (EUPEO) is concentrated in the vehicular communication. Through this process the communication is carried out in an effective manner with intelligent path planning of UAV and as well it reduces the delay and energy consumption. The idea is implemented in ns3 and from the final outcome it is obviously proven that the EUPEO method achieved superior results than previous methods concerned with efficiency and as well the delivery rate of the information transmitted.},

  abstract={Collaborative execution of data collection tasks by multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (Multi-UAV) can lead to reduced energy consumption, minimized interference, and extended network lifespan. To overcome the limitation of limited onboard energy and long search time for path planning by a single UAV, a multi-UAV path planning scheme is designed specifically for radar-threat environments. This scheme ensures that UAVs, while satisfying certain energy constraints, establish a Multi-UAV Multi-node Path Cost (MMPC) model. Each UAV needs to access different nodes with varying data volumes to upload while avoiding radar threats as much as possible. The objective is to find the optimal flight path for each UAV for minimizing the total path costs. Based on the basic Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) framework, this approach incorporates virtual nodes, modifies node selection strategies, adjusts path visibility factors and introduces the 2-opt method for node swapping. These enhancements improve the search efficiency to a certain extent, enhance the path diversity within the population and prevent the premature convergence to the local optima. Simulation results demonstrate the improved ACO's good convergence and the minimized path cost, thus validating its effectiveness.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a distributed solution to the navigation of a population of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to best localize a static source. The network is considered heterogeneous with UAVs equipped with received signal strength (RSS) sensors from which it is possible to estimate the distance from the source and/or the direction of arrival through adhoc rotations. This diversity in gathering and processing RSS measurements mitigates the loss of localization accuracy due to the adoption of low-complexity sensors. The UAVs plan their trajectories on-the-fly and in a distributed fashion. The collected data are disseminated through the network via multi-hops, therefore being subject to latency. Since not all the paths are equal in terms of information gathering rewards, the motion planning is formulated as a minimization of the uncertainty of the source position under UAV kinematic and anti-collision constraints and performed by 3D non-linear programming. The proposed analysis takes into account non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel conditions as well as measurement age caused by the latency constraints in communication.},

  abstract={When conducting visual landing, UAVs need to ensure the reasonableness of their flight trajectory and be under specific constraints on velocity and acceleration. Furthermore, to prevent the failure of the visual system, the cooperative target used for visual detection must always remain within the camera's field of view. In this paper, we first propose a PID controller-based IBVS guidance method. Then, a trajectory planning method based on the properties of Bezier curves and the tau coupling strategy is designed to satisfy the constraints on UAV velocity, acceleration, and camera field of view. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulation.},

  abstract={Cooperative multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely exploited in various applications, including data collection, forest monitoring, edge computing, and so on. Due to limited onboard storage and expensive hardware costs, reducing both the energy consumption and the number of UAVs is critical for these multi-UAV applications. However, existing studies primarily revolved around energy minimization in two-dimensional (2-D) scenarios, given a sufficient but fixed number of UAVs, and most of them considered specific application scenarios, resulting in poor generality. In contrast, this paper defines a generalized application scenario, in which multiple ground nodes (GNs) are accessed by multiple UAVs in three-dimensional (3-D) scenarios, and aims to minimize the energy consumption by employing the necessary (or equivalently minimum) number of UAVs and formulating a mix-integer nonconvex problem. To this end, this paper decomposes the problem into two subproblems: energy consumption minimization for a single UAV consecutively accessing any two GNs and energy-efficient multi-UAV GN-accessing path planning employing the minimum number of UAVs. The first subproblem is solved by applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and the path discretization method, while the second subproblem is addressed by designing a three-stage approximation framework based on modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and greedy path assignment (GPA). Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of optimality and efficiency compared to several other counterparts.},

  pages={1306-1324},
  abstract={Numerous applications require aerial surveillance. Civilian applications include monitoring forest fires, oil fields, and pipelines and tracking wildlife. Applications to homeland security include border patrol and monitoring the perimeter of nuclear power plants. Military applications are numerous. The current approach to these applications is to use a single manned vehicle for surveillance. However, manned vehicles are typically large and expensive. In addition, hazardous environments and operator fatigue can potentially threaten the life of the pilot. Therefore, there is a critical need for automating aerial surveillance using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This paper gives an overview of a cooperative control strategy for aerial surveillance that has been successfully flight tested on small (48-in wingspan) UAVs. Our approach to cooperative control problems can be summarized in four steps: 1) the definition of a cooperation constraint and cooperation objective; 2) the definition of a coordination variable as the minimal amount of information needed to effect cooperation; 3) the design of a centralized cooperation strategy; and 4) the use of consensus schemes to transform the centralized strategy into a decentralized algorithm. The effectiveness of the solution will be shown using both high-fidelity simulation and actual flight tests},

A threat intrusion strategy is designed for no safety path condition, which makes the cooperative path-planning method have excellent robustness. A cooperative path optimization method based on particle swarm optimization is adopted for the path length and collision avoidance requirements.

  abstract={Although the use of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has great potential for fast autonomous exploration, it has received far too little attention. In this article, we present a RApid Collaborative ExploRation (RACER) approach using a fleet of decentralized UAVs. To effectively dispatch the UAVs, a pairwise interaction based on an online hgrid space decomposition is used. It ensures that all UAVs simultaneously explore distinct regions, using only asynchronous and limited communication. Furthermore, we optimize the coverage paths of unknown space and balance the workloads partitioned to each UAV with a capacitated vehicle routing problem formulation. Given the task allocation, each UAV constantly updates the coverage path and incrementally extracts crucial information to support the exploration planning. A hierarchical planner finds exploration paths, refines local viewpoints, and generates minimum-time trajectories in sequence to explore the unknown space agilely and safely. The proposed approach is evaluated extensively, showing high exploration efficiency, scalability, and robustness to limited communication. Furthermore, for the first time, we achieve fully decentralized collaborative exploration with multiple UAVs in the real world. We will release our implementation as an open-source package.},

  abstract={One of the major research topics in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaborative control systems is the problem of multi-UAV target assignment and path planning (MUTAPP). It is a complicated optimization problem in which target assignment and path planning are solved separately. However, recalculation of the optimal results is too slow for real-time operations in dynamic environments because of the large number of calculations required. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence method named simultaneous target assignment and path planning (STAPP) based on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, which is a type of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. In STAPP, the MUTAPP problem is first constructed as a multi-agent system. Then, the MADDPG framework is used to train the system to solve target assignment and path planning simultaneously according to a corresponding reward structure. The proposed system can deal with dynamic environments effectively as its execution only requires the locations of the UAVs, targets, and threat areas. Real-time performance can be guaranteed as the neural network used in the system is simple. In addition, we develop a technique to improve the training effect and use experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract={This paper presents a receding path planning method using priority-based artificial potential field (PAPF) for UAV swarms considering moving obstacle and inter-UAV collision avoidance constraint. To enhance computational efficiency, PAPF is proposed to decouple the UAV swarm cooperative path planning problem into a series of single-UAV path planning problems. The receding planning mechanism is used to reduce the horizon of the path planning to further reduce the computational burden. In each planning horizon, when sequentially generating the paths of multiple UAVs, lower priority UAVs treat the path points of higher priority ones as obstacles for collision avoidance. Simulation studies show that PAPF can generally generate swarm paths in around Is on the scenario involving 16 UAVs, which verifies the efficiency merit of PAPF in solving dynamic path planning problems for UAV swarms.},

  abstract={Agriculture drones offer clear advantages over other monitoring methods including satellite imaging, manned scouting, and manned aircraft. However, for large scale areas, such as large forestry and agriculture mapping problems, the single drone is hard to accomplish its mission of mapping in a relatively short time period of 30 to 45 minutes. In addition, in large forestry mapping, camera, communication, and payload settings may further reduce the maximum endurance of drones in the air. With a single drone, the total required mission time to cover all the area is prolonged, not only producing a high cost for a drone service provider but also having more uncertainty. While with multiple drones, or a fleet of drones, it is possible to identify a globally optimized solution to reduce the total required mission time. In this paper, we mainly discuss the strategy of drone fleet deployment for large scale area surveying. Three key parts are analyzed, including a fleet of drones, cooperative coverage path planning, communication and data processing. The associated state-of-the-art solutions are listed and reviewed. In addition, in this paper, the key operational constraints for large scale agriculture and forestry surveying are analyzed. It should be pointed out that, from a comprehensive point of view, a drone fleet deployment for large scale surveying could attract more attention from the commercial drone industry.},

  abstract={Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with edge server to assist terrestrial mobile edge computing (MEC) has attracted tremendous attention. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art schemes based on deterministic optimizations or single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) cannot reduce the backlog of task bits and simultaneously improve energy efficiency in highly dynamic network environments, where the design problem amounts to a sequential decision-making problem. In order to address the aforementioned problems, as well as the curses of dimensionality introduced by the growing number of terrestrial terrestrial users, this paper proposes a distributed multi-objective (MO) dynamic trajectory planning and offloading scheduling scheme, integrated with MORL and the kernel method. The design of n-step return is also applied to average fluctuations in the backlog. Numerical results reveal that the n-step return can benefit the proposed kernel-based approach, achieving significant improvement in the long-term average backlog performance, compared to the conventional 1-step return design. Due to such design and the kernel-based neural network, to which decision-making features can be continuously added, the kernel-based approach can outperform the approach based on fully-connected deep neural network, yielding improvement in energy consumption and the backlog performance, as well as a significant reduction in decision-making and online learning time.},

  abstract={Mission planning can be solved as a combinatorial optimization problem which involves computing the path and selecting the agents that will be assigned to a given task. In scenarios with multiple UAVs, the proper control of the vehicle to achieve the proposed path is also a relevant task. This paper proposes a solution to the mission planning problem that involves probabilistic search and optimization of path planning and a graph-based combinatorial solution of task assignment. In addition, we propose an invariant model predictive controller based on the SO(2) manifold to deal with the execution of UAV missions. Our results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of assigning all agents to tasks and computing a viable and smooth trajectory for the UAVs to follow. Also, the control strategy is capable of guiding the vehicle through the trajectories generated from a start position to the task location.},

  abstract={Energy efficiency is crucial when wireless nodes are deployed in a remote or isolated area. This paper provides an optimal solution for data gathering from a wide area Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed as an optimization method to find the waypoints for a UAV in order to reduce the energy consumption and bit error rate (BER) of the sensor nodes, and the UAV travel time. In our previous work, the sensor nodes were required to transmit data to a Cluster Head (CH) node, which then forwarded the data to the UAV. The waypoints were restricted to be straight above the CH. In this work we employ cooperative relay, to make the data gathering more efficient. In addition, the waypoints of the UAV can be selected freely. To illustrate the effectiveness, we compare our new strategy to the one of our previous paper. Numerical results illustrate that the performance gap between them increases with the number of waypoints, in favor of the new strategy. Furthermore, the optimal number of waypoints for the UAV is also described, based on the size of the sensor network area and the density of the sensor node distribution. These contributions have maximized the network lifetime and communication quality, while minimized the UAV's flying time.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated increasing attention and promise. They demonstrate great potential for application in both civilian and military fields. In this context, collision-avoidance (CA) approaches play an extremely important role in collaborative and noncollaborative UAVs in a common airspace for reliable and safe operation. In this article, we give an analysis and description of the CA functions, including the CA process, state sensing, conflict detection, and conflict resolution. Then, an overview of the recent progress in CA technologies is systematically provided, particularly in terms of sensing techniques, conflict detection, and conflict resolution. The state-sensing methods include ground-based and air-based sensing technologies, and cooperative and non-cooperative sensing. The conflict-detection methods contain conflict detection with certainty and without certainty. The conflict-resolution methods include methods for individual UAVs and for UAV formation. In addition, several challenging problems are introduced to develop a lucid research direction. This review gives a unique perspective and contributes toward the further development of CA approaches for UAVs.},

  abstract={Considering the dynamic environments where mechanical failures and/or ground-based threats take place, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be lost when performing tasks. As such, designing path planning algorithms in such dynamic scenarios poses significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a cooperative path planning algorithm that is decentralized and adapts to the dynamic environments. This algorithm consists of two stages: in the static stage (i.e., before starting from the base station), the path planning is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) problem that the optimal solutions can be obtained by specific solvers; in the dynamic stages (i.e., during UAVs' flight), task reassignment is adaptively conducted among surviving UAVs' cooperations once a UAV is lost. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we demonstrate its superior performance through simulations compared to centralized ones in terms of the ratio of mission completion and the total completion time.},

  abstract={Deploying intelligent service and executing inference tasks in the proximity of the edge enable models to access enormous real-time data generated by the edge devices. However, the dilemma of fulfilling service demands with limited resources at edge devices impairs the efficacy of conventional data-oriented communication systems. To achieve a better trade-off between inference accuracy and communication overhead, in this paper, we propose a dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cooperative edge inference system, where a UAV acts as an edge server to aggregate the wide-view features from mobile sensors through Over-the-Air computation (AirComp) to complete the inference task cooperatively. Discriminant gain, an effective indicator for the inference accuracy, is adopted to realize task-oriented design. To exploit channel diversity and data diversity in the multi-device cooperative edge inference system, we maximize the discriminant gain of the AirComp feature aggregation by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and the power allocation policy with respect to the different important levels of feature dimensions. An alternating algorithm and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method are then proposed to solve the optimization problem. Numerical simulations further validate the efficacy of the proposed design compared to the baselines.},

Our main goal is to reconnect the isolated regions with the outside environment using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by building 3D aerial ad-hoc networks. Prior to network construction, we aim to capture the global map information over region of interests (RoI) by exploring all obstacles in the unknown region. We propose an efficient technique for collaborative 3D terrestrial exploration using multiple UAVs based on our distributed path planning algorithm, which finds collision-free exploration paths. Then, we present an optimal full-coverage 3D aerial ad-hoc network construction by deploying the minimum number of UAVs to indispensable spots while obtaining maximum network coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed exploration scheme outperforms several counterpart algorithms in terms of traversal time and redundant visit rate. Also, our network construction algorithm guarantees almost full coverage toward terrestrial space with only minimal UAV usage.},

  abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have experienced rapid development and have been widely used in many fields. Equipped with both communication modules and sensing modules, UAVs are capable of conducting integrated communication and target detection, thus greatly improving spectrum efficiency and system performance. In this article, we consider a scenario where multiple UAVs collaborate to detect targets and transmit the collected data to a central UAV. Addressing the problem of communication and perception scheduling, we first analyze the target detection and communication performance, and then formulate the joint communication and perception scheduling problem as two optimization problems, with the objectives being maximizing the average utility function (MAUF) and minimizing the completion time (MCT), respectively. To solve the formulated problems, we first consider the dynamic characteristics of the environment, and model the problems as two Markov decision processes. Regarding the UAVs as multiple agents, we then propose a multiagent double deep Q-network (DDQN)-based MAUF algorithm and a multiagent DDQN-based MCT algorithm to determine the communication and perception scheduling strategies of the UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms.},

However, it is very challenging for UAV to autonomously realize the quick full-coverage detection, considering the complicated operation environment, such as the pier obstruction problem.

We first provide two integer linear programs (ILPs) for the considered system by taking the coverage and the total power usage as the optimization targets. As a complement to the ILPs and to avoid intractable computation, the proposed CMA-TD algorithm can effectively solve the formulated problem via a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) process on a double deep Q-learning network (DDQN).

  abstract={Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used to ensure the security of wireless communications. In this paper, we propose a cooperative jamming scheme to secure cognitive radio (CR) networks. In the proposed scheme, the source UAV transmits confidential information to ground users. Because of the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve), the UAV jammer sends friendly interference signals to protect private information. It should be noted that the primary transmission of CR networks cannot be disturbed. Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average secrecy rate under the constraint of primary interference. Since trajectory planning and power control are coupled, we propose the alternative optimization (AO) algorithm. Furthermore, as the sub-problems are non-convex, sequential convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is a good choice, which makes our scheme converge to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. Simulation results show that the joint optimization of power and trajectory of our proposed scheme is effective for improving the systematic secure performance.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of edge computing technology, edge-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have become popular, helping with fast and cost-effective data collection in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) environments. This paper investigates the online data collection problem for MCS over an edge-assisted UAV network architecture, where UAVs work to collect the data required by tasks at different on-ground point-of-interests (PoIs) in an autonomous and cooperative manner. Different from conventional edge-assisted UAV networks, edge nodes in our paper help distribute, aggregate, share, and update the task state information (TSI, e.g., if a task has been completed, or if it still requires more data), to support efficient and cost-effective data collection, e.g., avoiding repetitive and ineffective task execution. In particular, a UAV can exchange TSI with an edge node when it is within the signal coverage of the edge node, while making decisions on PoI selection and path planning in an online and decentralized manner. To address the issue of edge-assisted UAV data collection, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm using personalized training with decentralized executing (PTDE) architecture. Different from the traditional centralized training with decentralized executing (CTDE) architecture, our considered architecture adopts the agent-specific state for critic networks instead of the joint observation, thus achieving effective utilization of environmental information. Furthermore, we propose an observation enhancement algorithm based on artificial potential field (APF). Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm greatly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of total profit, data collection ratio, geographical fairness, and energy efficiency.},

To address this problem, a novel hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, namely, SDPSO, is proposed in this article. The proposed algorithm improves the update strategy of the global optimal solution in the PSO algorithm by merging the simulated annealing algorithm, which enhances the optimization ability and avoids falling into local convergence; each particle integrates the beneficial information of the optimal solution according to the dimensional learning strategy, which reduces the phenomenon of particles oscillation during the evolution process and increases the convergence speed of the SDPSO algorithm. The simulation results show that compared with PSO, dynamic-group-based cooperative optimization (DGBCO), gray wolf optimizer (GWO), RPSO, and two-swarm learning PSO (TSLPSO), the SDPSO algorithm can quickly plan higher quality paths for UAVs and has better robustness in complex 3-D environments.},

  abstract={Cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) require almost continuous cellular network connectivity to fulfill their missions successfully. However, the area (e.g., rural) they fly over may have partial coverage, making the path planning of such UAV missions a challenging task. Recently a tolerable outage duration is taken into account for such UAVs, and the trajectory optimization under this outage duration is studied. However, these existing studies consider only a single UAV and focus on optimization of each UAV's own path separately even in multi-UAV scenarios. In this paper, we study the trajectory optimization problem for cellular-enabled UAVs by taking into account the collaboration among UAVs. That is, for a given set of UAVs, each with a mission to fly from a starting point to an ending point, we aim to optimize the total mission completion time for all UAVs such that none of them has a connection outage more than a threshold. We let UAVs collaborate and provide connectivity as relays to each other to solve their outage problem and shorten their trajectories. We first model and solve this problem using nonlinear programming after discretization of the problem. Since it takes longer to solve the problem with such an approach, we then provide a graph-based approximate solution that runs fast. Numerical results show that the proposed approximate solution provides close to optimal results and performs better than state-of-the-art solutions that consider each UAV separately without collaboration among UAVs.},

Also, the change in performance with respect to varying prediction horizon is analyzed through numerical simulations. As a result of predictive optimal control and cooperation, we get less conservative maneuvers, reduced path lengths, and less deviation from the shortest path when compared to the conventional method without prediction and cooperation.

To generate look-ahead coverage trajectories over a finite planning horizon, the proposed approach integrates visibility constraints into the proposed coverage controller in order to determine the visible part of the object with respect to the agents' future states.

  abstract={The three-dimensional (3-D) path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is a multi-objective optimization problem. In this work, an improved butterfly optimization algorithm (IBOA) based on the virtual center butterfly (VCB) and Neighborhood dimension perturbation learning (NDPL) is proposed to solve the problem. Since BOA executes a global search using pairwise interactions between two random butterflies (random operators). It makes the algorithm susceptible to missing the optimal solution, resulting in a lack of exploration capability. Therefore, we designed a novel VCB strategy to improve the exploration capability of the algorithm by creating attraction or repulsion effects on butterflies during the global phase. In the exploitation phase, the other individuals gravitate toward the best individual. If the best individual falls into the local extremes, the algorithm converges prematurely and with low precision. A new NDPL method is proposed that enhances the local mining capability of the algorithm by constructing a neighborhood matrix and learning from individuals in the neighborhood. The results of the simulation experiment in four scenarios demonstrate that the IBOA can effectively acquire a practical and effective path, and it performs better than the other six algorithms.},

  abstract={This paper provides an approach for the deconfliction problem for a pair of constant altitude, constant speed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) modeled as unicycles in the presence of static constraints. We use a combination of navigation and swirling functions to direct the unicycle vehicles along the planned trajectories while avoiding intervehicle collisions. The main feature of our contribution is proposing means of designing a deconfliction algorithm for unicycle vehicles that more closely capture the dynamics of constant speed UAVs as opposed to double integrator models. Specifically, we consider the issue of UAV turn-rate constraints and proceed to explore the selection of key algorithmic parameters in order to minimize undesirable trajectories and overshoots induced by the avoidance algorithm. The avoidance and convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is then performed for two cooperative UAVs and simulation results are provided to support the viability of the proposed framework for more general mission scenarios.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) have become a new paradigm for marine monitoring and disaster rescue. In AI-enabled UAV applications, UAVs generate amounts of computation-intensive tasks (e.g., image recognition, video processing, and path planning, etc.) that cannot be locally executed by UAVs in time. How to offload the computation-intensive tasks of UAVs timely and effectively has become an urgent challenge. Multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) integrated into a USV fleet is appealingly advocated to provide abundant computation resources for computation tasks. In this paper, we propose a collaborative computation offloading scheme with UAVs and USV fleets in maritime communication networks. Specifically, we first propose a collaborative computation offloading framework, where UAVs act as the requesters of computation offloading, and USV fleets are the assistants. Then, to minimize the overall execution time of computation tasks, UAVs determine the optimal ratio of compu-tation tasks offloaded to USV fleets in the worst case. Afterwards, the first sealed reverse auction with reserve price is utilized to incentivize USV fleets to assist in executing computation tasks of UAVs, where the reserve price guarantees the satisfied benefits of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the overall execution time and improves the expected revenue of the USV fleet as compared to conventional schemes.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the coverage path planning problem when an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys an unknown site composed of multiple isolated areas. The problem is typically NP-hard and cannot be easily solved, especially when considering the scale of each area. By decomposing the problem into two cascaded sub-problems—1) covering a specific polygon area and 2) determining the optimal visiting order of different areas—an approximate solution can be found more efficiently. First, the target areas are approximated as convex polygons, and the coverage pattern is designed based on four control points. Then, the optimal visiting order is determined based on a state defined by area indices and control points. We propose two different optimization methods to solve this problem. The first method is a direct extension of the genetic algorithm, using a customized coding method. The second method is a reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) approach that solves the problem as a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) through end-to-end policy training. The simulation results indicate that the proposed methods can provide solutions to the multiple-area coverage problem with competitive optimality and efficiency.},

  abstract={The near-space communication relay platform has a broad application prospect and development potential in the field of over-the-horizon communication support. In this paper, we investigate a throughput oriented, real-time path planning method for the high-altitude Solar-Powered UAV (SP-UAV) to ensure high quality communication of long-range mission UAVs. Firstly, based on the spatial distribution, the Channel State Information (CSI) and the potential field theory, we design the channel-aware-aided relay SP-UAV which is capable of adaptively changing its position, while maximizing the total throughput of the communication system. Secondly, in the feedback loop design, a cooperative game theory model is introduced to formulate a feedback-aided strategy for adjusting the weighting factors, which can further improve the whole communication performance. Specifically, to ensure the real-time performance, a low complexity algorithm and the real-time updated system conditions are applied in calculating the planning trajectory of the relay UAV. Simulation results show that compared with the relay UAV with a fixed cruise trajectory, our proposed scheme achieves better network throughput and has good tracking adaptability.},

  title={Informative Trajectory Planning for Air-Ground Cooperative Monitoring of Spatiotemporal Fields},

  pages={1-12},
  abstract={This paper investigates an air-ground cooperative monitoring problem for spatiotemporal fields, such as air pollution, forest fires, oil spills, etc, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). To fully exploit complementarities of these heterogeneous vehicles and improve efficiency of the cooperative monitoring, we design a novel cooperation scheme: each UAV is assigned to loiter over and transmit its observations to a pre-allocated UGV, and the UGV provides guidance on informative trajectories for the UAV and aims to reach a target position as fast as possible. Such a scheme brings challenges to informative trajectory planning of the UGVs, lying in the delayed observations from the UAVs and the cumulative information constraint depending on the unknown field. To overcome them, this work proposes a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based trajectory planning method to learn continuous policies for the UGVs, where a field estimator is designed for each UGV to recover observability of the field. In addition, we derive model predictive control (MPC)-based trajectory planners for the UAVs with tailored reference positions, where the uncertain tracking errors can be handled by the RL-based method of the UGVs. Thus, a performance coupling problem of the heterogeneous vehicles is tackled. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning methods and the efficiency of the air-ground cooperative monitoring scheme. Note to Practitioners—This article is motivated by cooperative monitoring tasks with UAVs and UGVs in practical applications, such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue after disasters, etc. Due to the complex dynamics of spatiotemporal fields in these tasks, trajectory planning for the cooperative monitoring system is challenging and requires much computations. To resolve the issues, we propose a novel cooperation scheme in this article, where the large computational capability of the UGVs is utilized to solve a minimum-time trajectory planning problem under a cumulative information constraint, and the UAVs only loiter over and transmit measurements about the field to the UGVs. To achieve this scheme, RL-based and MPC-based trajectory planning methods are proposed for the UGVs and the UAVs, respectively. Simulations have validated the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning methods and good performance of the cooperative monitoring system.},

  abstract={The deployment flexibility and maneuverability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) increased their adoption in various applications, such as wildfire tracking, border monitoring, etc. In many critical applications, UAVs capture images and other sensory data and then send the captured data to remote servers for inference and data processing tasks. However, this approach is not always practical in real-time applications due to the connection instability, limited bandwidth, and end-to-end latency. One promising solution is to divide the inference requests into multiple parts (layers or segments), with each part being executed in a different UAV based on the available resources. Furthermore, some applications require the UAVs to traverse certain areas and capture incidents; thus, planning their paths becomes critical particularly, to reduce the latency of making the collaborative inference process. Specifically, planning the UAVs trajectory can reduce the data transmission latency by communicating with devices in the same proximity while mitigating the transmission interference. This work aims to design a model for distributed collaborative inference requests and path planning in a UAV swarm while respecting the resource constraints due to the computational load and memory usage of the inference requests. The model is formulated as an optimization problem and aims to minimize latency. The formulated problem is NP-hard so finding the optimal solution is quite complex; thus, this article introduces a real-time and dynamic solution for online applications using deep reinforcement learning. We conduct extensive simulations and compare our results to the state-of-the-art studies demonstrating that our model outperforms the competing models.},

  abstract={Coverage path planning is an important research direction for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which are primarily used in ground search or mapping scenarios. Although there have been a large number of studies on UAV coverage path planning, there are still some problems in the cooperative work of multi-UAV in complex environments under the constraints of energy consumption and work efficiency requirements of UAV. To solve unnecessary energy loss when multiple UAVs jointly execute complex area coverage tasks and improve the overall work efficiency of the UAV swarm. In this study, we simulated the situation of multiple UAVs performing the mission of area coverage under the constraints of the corresponding energy consumption in a work environment with no-fly zones. We propose the use of multiple UAV base stations to provide takeoff and landing services for UAVs that perform missions. We proposed two algorithms. One is the multi-base station multi-UAV cooperative coverage path planning algorithm with flexible obstacle avoidance ability (MBS-MUCCPPAFOA), which performs coverage route planning from an entire area using multiple base stations to perform multi-UAV area coverage tasks. The other algorithm is a multi-UAV cooperative coverage path planning algorithm with flexible obstacle avoidance capability based on area segmentation (MUAV-CCPPAFOA-AS), which divides the entire work area and performs coverage path planning for each sub-area to perform multi-UAV area coverage tasks. We compared the proposed algorithm with the common scanning coverage path planning algorithm, and proved the robustness of the proposed MBS-MUCCPPAFOA and MUAV-CCPPAFOA-AS algorithms.},

  abstract={Heterogeneous UGV-UAV system can efficiently complete large-scale tasks such as exploration and rescue by collaborative operation. This paper proposes a route planner based on a dynamic aggregation strategy to select the time-optimal routes for function-constrained UGV and fuel-constrained UAV to reach all the mission points. To reduce the time consumption of waiting at the take-off point, UGV and UAV are inclined to rendezvous at the next meeting point by no-wait operations. We present a two-step routing strategy to address this cooperative problem. First, the Voronoi diagram and greedy set cover method are used to determine meeting points and task areas. Then, solving a traveling salesman problem to find a UGV path by A-star and Lin-Kernighan heuristic. After that, an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is proposed to address vehicle routing problem with recharge for UAV among multiple task areas. The simulation and real experiment results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate a time-optimal path for UGV-UAV Cooperative exploration.},

  abstract={When unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are carrying out missions, they are faced with complex task environments. To enhance the adaptability of UAV applications, it is required that they possess fast path-planning capabilities. This article takes the execution of complex tasks by multiple UAVs in a 3-D environment as background and transforms the path-planning problem into a multiconstraint optimization problem. Innovatively combining the hunter–prey optimizer (HPO) algorithm and task allocation mechanism, this study achieves collaborative path planning for multiple UAVs for complex tasks. In order to improve the optimization speed of the HPO algorithm, the following improvements have been made: first, introducing the chaotic mapping model to improve the performance of population initialization; second, adopting the golden sine strategy to change the population update strategy and accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Then, the single-peak and multipeak benchmark functions are used to test the average, standard deviation, and optimal values of the algorithm. Finally, path planning experiments are carried out in a 3-D map with multiple task points and obstacles, and the results show that the adapt golden sine HOP (AGSHPO) algorithm improves the robustness and real-time performance of the UAVs when executing complex tasks to a certain extent.},

Effective resource deployment is still difficult in modern SAR missions, especially in complex and unexpected circumstances. Conventional techniques for multi-UAV systems for SAR operations frequently have difficulties responding to changing conditions. This research proposes a unique method of combining 6G communication technology and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to improve the cognitive capacities of multi-UAV systems for cooperative coverage to enhance autonomous decision-making in challenging environments. The proposed Coverage Path Planning-Online Time-based Policy Optimization (CPP-OTPO) system utilizes DRL to imbue a multi-UAV framework capable of enabling adaptive decision-making based on realtime observations. The integration of 6G communication further enhances connectivity among multi-UAV systems. The system incorporates boundary search techniques in UAV path planning to achieve optimized CPP, emphasizing resilience against navigational uncertainties. Additionally, the proposed OTPO improves the effectiveness of the target search and increases the possibility of detecting targets by guiding UAVs to change their search policies from exploiting to exploring when required. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a remarkable 92.2% operational time efficiency compared to traditional algorithms.},

  abstract={Autonomous cooperative flight of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex and unknown environments, such as jungles, poses significant challenges. Existing approaches often rely on wireless communication or omnidirectional vision to achieve cooperation. This article presents a dual-horizon nonlinear model-predictive control (NMPC) scheme for vision-limited multi-UAV systems in cluttered scenarios. The proposed scheme serves as a local path planner for UAVs equipped with forward vision limited to a 160$^\circ$ field of view, enabling distributed cooperative flight, obstacle avoidance, and navigation. To expand the observation area, UAVs randomly oscillate left and right around their direction of motion. The NMPC employs an objective function incorporating distributed cooperative flight and obstacle avoidance considerations during navigation. This objective function consists of short-term reactive objectives to maintain formation and consistent distance from neighbors and long-term predictive objectives for planning collision-free trajectories. CasADi, an open-source tool for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation, is utilized to solve the NMPC problem. The trajectory calculation is performed using initial conditions and fed as additional input to the NMPC. The first control signal of the predictive control sequence is then transmitted to the autopilot for UAV control. The proposed NMPC approach provides real-time solutions with a 10-Hz operating frequency and a 2-s prediction horizon, making it suitable as a local path planner. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in three challenging scenarios using Gazebo-ROS.},

This new approach affords a holistic control on the two UAVs that is based on the relative motion of one UAV with respect to the other. In this way the two UAVs are now controlled as a single manipulator with an end-effector and posture control. Thus, any control strategy of a single manipulator can now be applied to the control of the two UAVs.

  abstract={With the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, the path planning problem in UAV cooperative operations has become increasingly prominent. This paper studies the path planning problem of UAV swarms, aiming to propose an effective method to improve the efficiency and safety of task execution. The Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) is a popular optimization algorithm known for its high performance. However, it sometimes encounters issues such as low efficiency in spiral flight and slow predator speed, leading to slow convergence and susceptibility to local optima. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Multi-strategy Enhanced Marine Predator Algorithm (MEMPA). The four enhancement strategies are: random spiral flight strategy, crisscross strategy, centroid boundary control strategy, and improved update rules for eddy formation and the FADs’ effect. These strategies collectively enhance the algorithm’s global search ability and its capacity to escape local optima. Compared with FDB-PPSO, AGWO, HPHHO, LSHADE, LSHADE-cnEpSin, MadDE, NMPA, QQLMPA, and the original MPA across four different dimensions of the 30 CEC2017 test functions, the Wilcoxon rank sum test results show that MEMPA outperforms the original MPA by 21, 19, 22, and 25 on the four dimensions, respectively. According to the results of the Friedman mean rank test, the top three algorithms are LSHADE, MPA, and MEMPA, with scores of 2.91, 2.77, and 2.14, respectively. Additionally, the proposed MEMPA was used to solve the UAV swarm path planning problem. The results show that the solutions obtained by MEMPA are 10%, 10%, and 13% better than those obtained by MPA, NMPA, and QQLMPA, respectively. It is superior to the selected comparison algorithms in terms of solution effectiveness and stability, demonstrating its potential in practical applications.},

The ellipse tangent method is used to avoid obstacles for the interference of urban obstacles. Furthermore, taking into account the cooperation of multi-UAV formation, the cooperative model based on moving cost and formation stability is established. Due to the timeliness requirement of multi-UAV cooperative surveillance task, we use a sparrow search algorithm with fast convergence speed and strong optimization capability to solve the cooperative model. Finally, the simulation experimental results in an urban environment with obstacle information demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in tackling the issues of cooperative obstacle avoidance and target surveillance.},

  abstract={Swarm technology for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has gained popularity in the last few years due to their potential for civilian and military applications. Intelligent swarm systems are very efficient at solving group-level problems and their capability to accomplish complex missions with no or little human intervention. One of the most challenging problems is operating in environments with surrounding obstacles such as buildings, thus, often obstructing inter-UAV communication. A UAV swarm is required to maintain continuous communication between its members and preserve the stability of its formation while flying towards an ultimate goal. In this paper we propose MSCS, a new cooperative and adaptive scheme for multi-clustered autonomous UAV swarms. This schemes allows several UAVs operating in a swarm formation to coordinate their navigation and path planning operations by using an adaptive multi-clustered leader-follower approach. The swarm members follow a dynamically elected leader based on the UAV with best fit to lead the swarm towards the destination. The coordination of the UAVs is achieved through SBP (Swarm Broadcast Protocol), a single-hop broadcast UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication protocol, which allows swarm members to exchange information about their current location and their local cluster leader. We present a set of performance results, which show that this scheme contributes efficiently at maintaining the swarm formation's stability at acceptable density and disconnection ratio.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are in general faster to deploy and easier to operate due to many off-the-shelf guidance, navigation, and control solutions. Such solutions usually support short-range line-of-sight operations. However, operating a swarm of UAVs for surveillance purposes in diverse terrains requires cost-effective wireless connectivity, infrastructure-less operation, adaptive mobility models, multiclass routing solutions, and a tailored ground control station . In this article, we address the challenge of UAV swarm communications by presenting a framework that offers an open-interface communication and networking solution for surveillance operations in urban/outreach areas. It is based on a hybrid connectivity module that can enable the coexistence of 5G infrastructures, adaptive multiband SDR waveforms empowered with cooperative communication capacities, and satellite communications for continuous swarm operation in any demographic area. In addition, we also discuss some of the current and futuristic applications and scenarios that can benefit from the provided solution.},

  abstract={With the development of high-speed and wide application of UAV technology, at the same time, UAV is faced with more and more complex applications, so its path obstacle avoidance has become a very key problem. One UAV can no longer meet the requirements of the application occasions under the current UAV application background, so the advantages of multiple UAVs are highlighted. UAVs are developing towards the direction of cluster cooperative operation, which is the main development direction of UAVs in the future. UAVs cluster operation means that multiple UAVs communicate with each other to exchange information to achieve coordinated flight, coordinated reconnaissance and coordinated operations. UAV cluster cooperative flight operation must consider the problem of obstacle avoidance between UAVs. Based on the Boid model, this paper proposes a UAV cooperative flight algorithm, and tests the feasibility of the algorithm by using 10 and 20 UAVs in a gradually increasing number based on the 3D test environment. Finally, the simulation results verify that the algorithm has good feasibility in the obstacle avoidance of large-scale UAV 3D cooperative flight between UAVs.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, the multi-UAV cooperative search has wide applications in the field of Internet of Things, such as resource exploration, emergency rescue, intelligent transportation, etc. However, the communication network in an unknown environment may be inaccessible, and the real-time information sharing among UAVs cannot be guaranteed, resulting in the failure of cooperative search. Aiming at this issue, this article is devoted to the design of the multi-UAV flight strategy to improve the cooperative search capability in an uncertain communication environment. Specifically, a new cooperative architecture oriented to a local communication network is devised to control the observation locations of multiple UAVs in the search process, and some local communication networks are established based on the distance among UAVs to meet the requirements of the search task. On this foundation, we develop a multi-UAV cooperative search model (MCSM) with communication cost and formation benefit as an optimization function to ensure the effectiveness of multi-UAV search. Moreover, in the process of model solving, an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) is presented with some different search strategies to enhance the optimization capability. To verify the superiority of the proposed method, we designed several groups of simulation experiments to analyze the performance of MCSM. Experimental results illustrate that our method can not only maintain high cooperative search accuracy but also has high stability and convergence speed.},

  abstract={Data forwarding from a source to a sink node when they are not within the communication range is a challenging problem in wireless networking. With the increasing demand of wireless networks, several applications have emerged where a group of users are disconnected from their targeted destinations. Therefore, we consider in this paper a multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) system to convey collected data from isolated fields to the base station. In each field, a group of sensors or Internet of Things devices are distributed and send their data to one UAV. The UAVs collaborate in forwarding the collected data to the base station in order to maximize the minimum battery level for all UAVs by the end of the service time. Hence, a group of UAVs can meet at a waypoint along their path to the base station such that one UAV collects the data from all other UAVs and moves forward to another meeting point or the base station. All other UAVs that relayed their messages return back to their initial locations. All collected data from all fields reach to the base station within a certain maximum time to guarantee a certain quality of service. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), then we reformulated the problem as Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) after we linearize the mathematical model. Simulations results show the advantages of adopting the proposed model in using the UAVs' energy more efficiently.},

  abstract={This brief is concerned with integrated autonomous takeoff, target search, task assignment, and tracking using multiple fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban environments. The problem is to design flight autonomy that is embedded onboard each UAV to enable autonomous flight coordination and distributed tasking. Control logic design based on a finite state automaton model, integrating four modes of operations, namely, the takeoff mode, the fly-to-area of operation mode, the search mode, and the tracking mode, is presented. Different from the state-of-the-art of recent research, this brief provides a preliminary research on the autonomous cooperative takeoff for miniature fixed-wing UAVs, by considering collision avoidance, communication failure, etc. To make UAVs autonomously and cooperatively search roads in the urban environments, an efficient improved search algorithm is proposed based on recent research on the coverage search in the literature. For the target tracking, using geometric relations (relative position, orientations, speed ratio, and minimal turning radius), a systematic algorithm is developed to generate an optimal online path. All the algorithms in this work are developed based on realistic miniature fixed-wing UAV dynamic models. The main focus of the brief is to test the developed control logic and also the algorithms. The proposed framework is evaluated by our 3-D multi-UAV test bed.},

  abstract={In recent years, joint radar and communication (JRC) has gained substantial attention due to its high spectrum efficiency and equipment utilization. In this paper, we consider a JRC-enabled multi-UAV cooperative detection scenario, in which each UAV equipped with a JRC unit simultaneously performs the detection function to sense multiple targets and the communication function to transmit the detected data to a fusion center. To strike a trade-off between radar sensory and communication performance for all UAVs, we optimize the transmit power, resource allocation and navigation for each UAV to maximize their sensing scores and the geographical fairness of the targets on the condition of the quality requirements of communication and radar sensing. This problem is a mixed integer non-convex optimization that is challenging to be solved in practice. Considering the complexity of the optimization and dynamics of the UAV environment, we design a learning based trajectory planning and resource allocation (LTPRA) algorithm that leverages multiple learning agents to find effective policies from experiences while guaranteeing communication and sensing performance. To improve the environmental exploration of agents, we design an incentive mechanism for their detection behavior and introduce a policy regularization method to mitigate policy overfitting in multi-agent cooperation. Numerical results reveal the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm and show the improvement on detection and communication performance in JRC-enabled multi-UAV detection systems compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

Firstly, the UAV formation model of fixed undirected communication topology was established. For the issues that may occur such as deadlocks and formation safety, the segmented idea, rotation force and potential force between the machines were introduced to improve the force function of the potential field, which made the formation realize obstacle avoidance and trajectory pre-planning accurately. Secondly, the state error of UAV was corrected according to the consistency theory, and the formation cooperative obstacle avoidance control law was designed to achieve the desired state consistency and track planning. Finally, the convergence consistency of the proposed control algorithm was proved by constructing Hamilton function.

  year={2023},
  volume={53},
  number={1},
  pages={275-288},
  abstract={In our earlier study, an energy-efficient passive UAV radar imaging system was formulated, which comprehensively analyzed the system performance. In this article, based on the evaluator set, a mission planning framework for the underlying energy-efficient passive UAV radar imaging system is proposed to achieve optimized mission performance for a given remote sensing task. First, the mission planning problem is defined in the context of the proposed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system and a general framework is outlined, including mission specification, illuminator selection, and path planning. It is found that the performance of the system is highly dependent upon the flight path adopted by the UAV platform in a 3-D terrain environment, which offers the potential of optimizing the mission performance by adjusting the UAV path. Then, the path planning problem is modeled as a single-objective optimization problem with multiple constraints. Path planning can be divided into two substages based on different mission orientations and low mutual correlation. Based on this property, a path planning method, called substage division collaborative search (Sub-DiCoS), is proposed. The problem is divided into two subproblems with the corresponding decision space and subpopulation, which significantly relax the constraints for each subproblem and facilitates the search for feasible solutions. Then, differential evolution and the whole-stage best guidance technique are devised to cooperatively lead the subpopulations to search for the best solution. Finally, simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sub-DiCoS method. The result of the mission planning method can be used to guide the UAV platform to safely travel through a 3-D rough terrain in an energy-efficient manner and achieve optimized SAR imaging and communication performance during the flight.},

  abstract={When deploying multiple UAVs each with its own sensor platform into an unstructured environment, the swarm of these sensor platforms, i.e. the team of UAVs needs to deploy in a manner that will gather information about the local environment, identify and track objects of interest, and act in a co-operative and robust manner. Guidance strategies that result in UAV platforms covering the area of interest whilst avoiding obstacle, and allow UAV platforms to arrive at specific positions at specific times and with specific sensor orientation, is the focus of this presentation. The use of Dudin's sets would provide the framework for guidance and navigation. Coordinated path planning of multiple UAVs for simultaneous arrival with safe flight-paths is described. The simultaneous arrival of all UAVs is guaranteed by paths of equal lengths. Two conditions, namely minimum separation distance and non-intersection of paths at equal length are used/proposed to ensure the safe flight-path of UAVs. These conditions are to avoid inter-UAVs collision. The Dubins paths are used for the path planning. Bisection method is used to find the optimal turning radii of paths. The path planning guarantees design of paths of equal length with shortest paths. This is having advantages in reducing fuel consumption and increasing the durability of UAVs. Furthermore formal modelling techniques are applied to this problem of multi-UAV coordination, decision making and path planning. When UAV teams are called to operate in areas with uncertain information it is impossible to validate every conceivable situation that might arise in operation in such scenarios. By using formal techniques, aspects of the operating model that must necessarily hold true throughout can be mathematically validated. Kripke models of "possible" worlds are used to represent formally a multi-UAV scenario, where availability of environment information is to be used by the team to collect, exchange and utilise available information to make a complete survey of the specified area. The ability of our proposed Kripke model to cope with the uncertainties and decision making involved in this process can be verified using an exhaustive proof technique known as model checking.},

  abstract={Multi-agent cooperative target tracking plays a significant role in distributed artificial intelligence for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Most existing tracking solutions using online path planning focus on general target trajectories. Such trajectories have strong regularity and are smooth with minimal fluctuations. However, in real UAV applications a target will change its trajectory frequently to prevent from being tracked, and thus its trajectory will fluctuate greatly and randomly. To this end, in this paper we consider a realistic scenario where the UAV target trajectory is changeable and random. For real-time target tracking, we formulate the tracking task as a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem, the objective of which is to optimize tracking performance under various constraints. To do so, we innovatively combine the adaptive differential evolution (ADE) algorithm with Nash optimization, and then propose a Nash-combined ADE method. Specifically, we use ADE to adaptively adjust the predicted trajectory of each UAV agent and Nash optimization to efficiently solve DMPC formulation for global optimization, which can improve the tracking accuracy and simultaneously reduce the computational complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs well in terms of tracking accuracy, UAV collision avoidance and tracking stability for realistic target trajectories.},

  abstract={The last decade has witnessed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) emerging as a powerful platform for various industrial and civilian applications. However, refrained by limited battery capacities, the hovering time of UAVs is still limited, impeding them from achieving remote tasks, such as wide area inspection. To deal with such long-range applications, a common sense solution is to employ vehicles to transport, launch, and recycle UAVs. Efficient routing and scheduling for UAVs and vehicles can greatly reduce time consumption and financial expenses incurred in long-range inspection. Nevertheless, prior works in vehicle-assisted UAV inspection considered only one UAV, and was incapable of concurrently serving multiple targets distributed in an area. Leveraging multiple UAVs to serve multiple targets in parallel can significantly enhance efficiency and expand service areas. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), which supports the cooperation of one vehicle and multiple drones for wide area inspection applications. HGA allows multiple UAVs to launch and recycle in different locations, minimizing time wastage for both the vehicle and UAVs. Performance evaluation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm when compared with existing solutions.},

To maximize the GUs' minimum throughput, we propose a collaborative mode switching scheme for the dual-mode UAVs to dynamically switch between the active RF and passive ARIS modes according to the time-varying channel conditions. Besides, we jointly optimize the GUs' transmission control, the UAVs' beamforming, and the trajectory planning strategies. This optimization problem is intractable directly due to the non-convexity in both the objective and constraints. We design an iterative algorithm to first decompose the original problem into several subproblems, and then solve each subproblem individually by approximate optimization methods. Numerical results verify that the UAVs' collaborative mode switching along with their trajectories efficiently improves the transmission performance compared to the benchmarks in which both UAVs are operating in one fixed mode.},

  abstract={This letter presents an online trajectory planning algorithm for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to autonomously scan warehouse racks for inventory management. Our main motivation is to make small-sized UAVs with limited computing and sensing hardware capable of reliably performing the scanning task in cluttered environments. To this end, we propose a cooperative system where an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) guides the UAV using the novel template of visibility-aware cooperative navigation (VACNA). We propose a Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) based approach for solving the trajectory optimization underpinning VACNA. In particular, our CEM projects sampled vehicle trajectories onto the constraint sets before evaluating the cost functions. We further learn a deep generative model in the form of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) from expert demonstrations to warm-start our optimizer. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we present a detailed analysis of the role of our proposed cost and constraint functions for cooperative occlusion-free navigation. Second, we compare our custom CEM optimizer with conventional variants and show significantly reduced collision and occlusion rates. Finally, our CVAE initialization allows our optimizer to operate with smaller batch sizes and achieve real-time performance even on embedded hardware devices like NVIDIA Jetson Xavier.},

  abstract={In recent decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones) equipped with multiple sensors have been widely utilized in various applications. Nevertheless, constrained by limited battery capacities, the hovering time of UAVs is quite limited, prohibiting them from serving a wide area. To cater with remote sensing applications, people often employ vehicles to transport, launch, and recycle them. The so-called vehicle-drone cooperation (VDC) benefits from both the far driving distance of vehicles and the high mobility of UAVs. Efficient routing and scheduling can greatly reduce time consumption and financial expenses incurred in VDC. However, previous works in vehicle-drone cooperative sensing considered only one drone, thus unable to simultaneously cover multiple targets distributed in an area. Using multiple drones to sense different targets in parallel can significantly promote efficiency and expand service areas. Therefore, we propose a novel problem, referred to as vehicle-assisted multidrone routing and scheduling problem. To tackle the problem, we contribute an efficient algorithm, referred to as vehicle-assisted multi-UAV routing and scheduling algorithm (VURA). In VURA, we maintain and iteratively update a memory containing candidate UAV routes. VURA works by iteratively deriving solutions based on UAV routes picked from the memory. In every iteration, VURA jointly optimizes anchor point selection, path planning, and tour assignment via nested optimization operations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle this novel yet challenging problem. Finally, performance evaluation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm when compared with existing solutions.},

Compared with the prior methods which UAV-UGV cooperation system that only uses UAV to track UGV, our method is more effective and can give full play to the advantages of UAV and UGV. We use UAV visual tracking algorithm and coordinate transformation to get the target location, and use UGV to navigate to the target location to keep up with the target.

  abstract={This paper addresses the problem of path planning for a group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to carry out a reconnaissance mission given regions of interest (ROI) within a specified geographic area. Employing teams of UAVs may reduce the time to accomplish a required mission however the problem becomes one of optimal resource allocation and is NP-hard. Traversal through a partially known environment is challenging as information acquired by the sensors may reveal obstacles and/or high risk zones. Thus plans may need to be recomputed in real-time as the mission proceeds. UAVs may be lost or may suffer significant damage during such missions. Therefore multiple UAVs have better chance of completing a mission in the face of failures and obstacles if surviving agents can reconfigure their path plans based on shared information and move on to complete the mission. The proposed solution must be such that m UAVs start from multiple source locations to visit n targets and return to a set of destination locations such that (1) each target is visited exactly by one of the chosen uavs (2) the total distance traveled by the group is minimized and (3) the number of targets that each uav visits may not be less than K or greater than L.},

For unknown target, squared-root cubature information filtering (SCIF) is designed to estimate the target states based on the measurement from the onboard sensor at each UAV. To eliminate the difference between estimations of UAVs, the consensus algorithm, hybrid consensus on measurement-consensus on information is applied for more accurate estimation of target. A fast MPC method is introduced to obtain the UAVs’ path, where collision avoidance between UAVs and the change of communication topology among UAVs are taken into account.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to meet the requirements of diverse and efficient communication in the future, which act as aerial base stations (ABSs) with a better line-of-sight communication channels in air-to-ground communication networks. However, resource allocation, interference management and path planning of UAV ABSs have become a series of challenging problems. In this paper, trajectory design and downlink power control of multi-type UAV ABSs are jointly investigated. In order to meet the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirements of users, each UAV ABS needs to adjust its position and transmission power. We propose a non-cooperative mean-field-type game (MFTG) model to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmission power of UAV ABS based on the interactions among multiple communication links. In order to simplify the problem, we cluster the users in the given area to get the initial deployment of the UAV ABSs. Furthermore, the discrete MFTG problem is solved by the proposed mean field Q (MFQ)-learning algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can converge to the equilibrium solution, and reduce the energy cost of each UAV ABS effectively with satisfying the SINR.},

  abstract={Path planning is crucial for the successful mission execution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, planning feasible paths becomes challenging due to constraints imposed by complex environments and the inherent maneuverability of UAVs, particularly in large-scale scenarios involving multiple UAVs ( multi-UAV). This paper addresses the multi-UAV cooperative path planning problem, formulating it as a constrained optimization problem and proposing the evolutionary state estimation-based multi-strategy jellyfish search (ESE-MSJS) algorithm to search for high-quality paths. In the proposed algorithm, a switching framework based on evolutionary state estimation is constructed to prevent ineffective searches and enhance suitability for path planning. Within this framework, three distinct update modes are developed for each individual, enabling a more efficient and flexible selection of appropriate learning strategies. In addition, a neighborhood topology-based elite example learning strategy is employed to increase population diversity, and a best information guiding-driven adaptive scaling factor strategy exploits the surrounding space, strengthening local search capabilities. The Gaussian barebone mechanism is introduced to balance exploration and exploitation. To effectively cope with intricate constraints, a dynamic $\alpha$-level comparison strategy is incorporated into the individual update stage of the ESE-MSJS. Experimental results demonstrate that ESE-MSJS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms regarding accuracy, feasibility, and stability, proving to be an effective method for multi-UAV cooperative path planning in complex environments.},

  volume={15},

  abstract={Navigation problems of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) flying in a formation in a free and an obstacle-laden environment are investigated in this brief. When static obstacles popup during the flight, the UAVs are required to steer around them and also avoid collisions between each other. In order to achieve these goals, a new dual-mode control strategy is proposed: a "safe mode" is defined as an operation in an obstacle-free environment and a "danger mode" is activated when there is a chance of collision or when there are obstacles in the path. Safe mode achieves global optimization because the dynamics of all the UAVs participating in the formation are taken into account in the controller formulation. In the danger mode, a novel algorithm using a modified Grossberg neural network (GNN) is proposed for obstacle/collision avoidance. This decentralized algorithm in 2-D uses the geometry of the flight space to generate optimal/suboptimal trajectories. Extension of the proposed scheme for obstacle avoidance in a 3-D environment is shown. In order to handle practical vehicle constraints, a model predictive control-based tracking controller is used to track the references generated. Numerical results are provided to motivate this approach and to demonstrate its potential.},

  year={2023},
  volume={59},

  pages={9026-9041},
  abstract={Terrain risk estimation has always been a crucial but challenging task for autonomous driving of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) in off-road environments. The map with dense and accurate risk information can help UGV avoid special obstacles such as steep slopes, pits, and ditches while path planning. To solve this problem, this article proposes an aerial-ground collaboration system for continuous risk mapping in off-road environments, utilizing the flexibility and perspective advantages of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the system, UAV carries a downward 2-D laser and a visual inertial system to construct a bird's eye map, while UGV is equipped with a 3-D LiDAR for local mapping. In detail, our system focuses on two aspects, which are cross-view map matching and collaborative continuous risk mapping. For cross-view map matching, risk values for point clouds from aerial and ground platforms are calculated and used for terrain segmentation. Then, point-to-voxel residual is built for terrain point sets to accelerate matching. For collaborative continuous risk mapping, an entropy based probabilistic fusion is proposed for accurate risk fusion of overlapping cells. Then, a Bayesian generalized kernel inference algorithm is adapted to predict risk values of the remaining unknown areas. Simulation and real-world experimental results show that the dense and continuous global risk map constructed by the proposed system can effectively assist UGV for path planning in off-road environments.},

  abstract={Aiming at the problem of integrated task assignment and trajectory planning of a massive number of agents in the scenario with different priority task nodes and multiple static obstacles, this paper proposes a general framework based on bilayer-coupled mean field games, which couples the minimum cost of trajectory planning of an agent in the task assignment process to achieve a reasonable, globally optimal, and targeted adjustable assignment result. In the proposed general framework, firstly, the multi-population mean field game is used to plan the optimal trajectory of an agent between each pair of priority adjacent task nodes, and the minimum costs are calculated. Then, based on the discrete time finite state space mean field game, a task assignment model in the discrete task space is constructed, and the minimum costs obtained in the trajectory planning are coupled into the model as a reference, the task assignment strategies are finally obtained. Moreover, we give a specific example of the proposed general framework and prove the existence of equilibrium solutions of two mean field games. The effectiveness of the proposed general framework is demonstrated through simulation experiments and results analysis. Note to Practitioners—In multi-agent decision-making and control, task assignment and trajectory planning are two fundamental problems that coexist in many scenarios. Examples include the collaborative exploration of multiple task areas by UAV swarm, and the lane selection and efficient driving of autonomous vehicles. There are many methods for dealing with the integrated task assignment and trajectory planning. However, they have difficulties in dealing with large-scale agent problems, mainly due to the significant increase in communication and computation costs as the number of agents increases. In response to this problem, based on the characteristic of mean field game that transforms the game between individuals into a game between an individual and the whole, this paper proposes a general framework of bilayer-coupled mean field games for the scenario with different priority task nodes and multiple static obstacles. The multi-population mean field game is used to plan the optimal trajectory of agents, and the discrete time finite state space mean field game is utilized for task assignment, in which the cost of trajectory planning between task nodes is considered. We propose a specific example model and theoretically prove the existence of an equilibrium solution of this model. The effectiveness of the general framework is verified by simulation experiments and results analysis.},

In this paper, we present a novel UAV-USV cooperative task allocation scheme to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of information gathering and monitoring in smart ocean networks. Specifically, we first establish a UAV-USV cooperative task allocation framework, in which UAVs are deployed in the air to monitor the ocean environment (e.g., oil spills, disasters, etc.) and USVs cruise on the ocean to perform tasks (e.g., rescuing). Then, we employ the matching-coalition game model to enable the cooperation between UAVs and USVs for jointly maximizing their utilities. Afterwards, a stable matching-coalition game is proposed to obtain the optimal strategies of both UAVs and USVs as the Nash equilibrium solution to the formulated game. We finally conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the efficiency of task allocation in smart ocean networks.},

In order to reduce the computation time of DMPC, an improved grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is designed where pheromone factors are incorporated into GWO to strengthen the exploration ability of the original GWO. In addition, pheromones are optimally selected based on the hierarchy of wolves to guide subsequent iterations so that the convergence speed of the optimizer can be increased.

  abstract={Fleets of cooperative drones are a powerful tool in monitoring critical scenarios requiring early anomaly discovery and intervention. Due to limited energy availability and application requirements, drones may visit target points in consecutive trips, with recharging and data offloading in between. To capture timeliness of intervention and prioritize early coverage, we propose the new notion of Weighted Progressive Coverage, which is based on the definition of time dependent weights. Weighted progressive coverage generalizes classic notions of coverage, as well as a new notion of accumulative coverage specifically designed to address trip scheduling. We show that weighted progressive coverage maximization is NP-hard and propose an efficient polynomial algorithm, called Greedy and Prune (GaP), with guaranteed approximation. By means of simulations we show that GaP performs close to the optimal solution and outperforms a previous approach in all the considered performance metrics, including coverage, average inspection delay, energy consumption, and computation time, in a wide range of application scenarios. Through prototype experiments we also confirm the theoretical and simulation analysis, and demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm in real scenarios.},

  abstract={In emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios, a team of drones can be tasked to collect data at specific locations of interest, ferry it to remote places where a cloud infrastructure is used for sharing the collected data as a service to the community. In such an "Internet-of-Things in motion" scenario, terrain modeling, path finding, fair task allocation are key parameters upon which a successful mission depends. This paper describes a model developed to control a team of drones in order to cover irregular areas of uneven terrain. The model is based on an auction-based algorithm to coordinate the team of drones, relies on a 3D landscape model for path allocation. Experiments were conducted to assess the field readiness of the drone technology, simulated experiments were carried out to determine the relative eciency, the fairness of work allocation of the proposed model.},

  abstract={This article presents an optimal guidance approach for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation between two given points in 3D considering the wind influence. The proposed cost function to be minimized involves the weighting of the travel time and the control energy. An analytical expression is derived for the optimal cost yielding a fourth-order polynomial, whose positive real roots correspond to the optimal travel times. The optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to the zero-effort-miss/zero-effort-velocity optimal guidance approach for the case of a constant wind acceleration. Case studies for rendezvous and intercept problems are shown through simulation examples for different wind conditions.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the analysis, operation, and recovery of trajectory planning for UAV time-varying formation tracking a dynamic target under a GPS spoofing attack in a complex environment. Firstly, the desired formation position and pattern are considered sufficient conditions based on the Lyapunov stability theory (LST) to achieve formation tracking. then by introducing vertical components into LST to generate reference velocity, which can make the formation converge to an optimal tracking height in the process of tracking a 3D moving target. Secondly, an aspect to consider the problem is the spoofing attack sent by tracking a target on both the GPS data transmission channel and the communication link connecting the UAV. A collaborative localization method is designed that utilizes in-group distance measurement and target ranging to solve trajectory deviation problems caused by such GPS spoofing attacks, where the identification of the attack is based on cumulative error. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of this proposed strategy.},

  abstract={General differential equations for multi-objective reachability and optimal planning are used to guide autonomous air and sea drones in hazard-time optimal missions. The vehicles minimize exposure to hazards and travel time, leveraging the dynamic environments with strong flows and steering clear of dynamic hazardous regions. We demonstrate the approach first with an autonomous air drone that crosses the Atlantic Ocean optimizing travel time using trade winds while avoiding hazardous rain storms in the inter-tropical convergence zone. We then consider an air drone that exploits winds and avoids hazardous rains to transport an ocean vehicle to a target destination. The ocean vehicle then completes its own hazard-time optimal mission, leveraging ocean currents and avoiding vessel-traffic hazards. In all cases, we predict hazard-time reachable sets, Pareto fronts, and optimal paths. The results highlight the benefits of considering hazards in optimal path planning.},

  abstract={In recent years, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have exhibited significant market potential to greatly reduce the cost and time in the field of logistics. The use of UAVs to provide commercial courier has become an emerging industry, remarkably shifting the energy use of the freight sector. However, due to limited battery capacities, the flight duration of civilian rotorcraft UAVs is still short, hindering them from performing remote jobs. In this case, people customarily utilize ground vehicles to carry and assist UAVs in various applications, including cargo delivery. Most previous studies on vehicle-drone cooperative parcel delivery considered only one UAV, thereby suffering from low efficiency when serving a large number of customers. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid genetic algorithm, which supports the cooperation of a ground vehicle and multiple UAVs for efficient parcel delivery. Our routing and scheduling algorithm allows multiple UAVs carried by the vehicle to simultaneously deliver multiple parcels to customers residing in different locations. The proposed algorithm consists of a pipeline of several modules: population management, heuristic population initialization, and population education. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm has significant efficiency over existing algorithms.},

  title={Hitchhiker: A Quadrotor Aggressively Perching on a Moving Inclined Surface Using Compliant Suction Cup Gripper}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={21},

  pages={2552-2563},
  abstract={Perching on the surface of moving objects, like vehicles, could extend the flight time and range of quadrotors. Suction cups are usually adopted for surface attachment due to their durability and large adhesive force. To seal on a surfaces, suction cups must be aligned with the surface and possess proper relative tangential velocity. However, quadrotors’ attitude and relative velocity errors would become significant when the object surface is moving and inclined. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time trajectory planning algorithm. The time-optimal aggressive trajectory is efficiently generated through multimodal search in a dynamic time-domain. The velocity errors relative to the moving surface are alleviated. To further adapt to the residual errors, we design a compliant gripper using self-sealing cups. Multiple cups in different directions are integrated into a wheel-like mechanism to increase the tolerance to attitude errors. The wheel mechanism also eliminates the requirement of matching the attitude and tangential velocity. Extensive tests are conducted to perch on static and moving surfaces at various inclinations. Results demonstrate that our proposed system enables a quadrotor to reliably perch on moving inclined surfaces (up to  $1.07m/s$  and 90°) with a success rate of 70% or higher. The efficacy of the trajectory planner is also validated. Our gripper has larger adaptability to attitude errors and tangential velocities than conventional suction cup grippers. The success rate increases by 45% in dynamic perches. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of perching on moving inclined surfaces using quadrotors. It can be used for perching on the various angled surfaces of an automobile to save energy and enlarge flight distance. It can also be exploited in air-ground cooperative tasks. In recent years, various grippers and trajectory planning methods have been devised to enable quadrotors to perch on static inclined surfaces. These strategies can not be used for perching on moving inclined surfaces. The task poses high requirements for the efficiency of trajectory planning and the grippers’ adaptability to pose errors. This paper proposes a real-time planning method to generate trajectories. The trajectories respect kinematic and motor lift constraints. They allow large attitude maneuvering of quadrotors. A multimodal search in a dynamic time-domain is developed to seek the minimum feasible time for the trajectory planner. Considering large pose errors in dynamic perching, a compliant gripper based on multiple independent suction cups is designed. The wheel and multidirectional layout of cups increase the adaptability to attitude and velocity errors. Results suggest that the proposed system is effective and reliable. In practice, our multiple cups would add weight penalty and increase the drag. The suction cups should be placed close to a quadrotor’s central axis to reduce the drag and disturbance in flow. The proposed system relies on an external motion capture system. In future research, we will focus on onboard sensing and control methods to achieve perching on moving inclined surfaces outdoors.},

  abstract={This paper considers a multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-assisted IoT network, where the UAVs cooperatively collect data packets generated by the IoT devices (IDs) and transmit them to the Base Station (BS) continuously to improve the information freshness, in terms of the age of information (AoI). Particularly, we first formulate multi- UAV distributed cooperative dynamic trajectory planning problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), where the update arrivals at IDs are stochastic and are unknown to the UAVs. Furthermore, in order to address the challenges arising from unknown environmental dynamics and conflict collision constraints, we devise a multi-agent deep rein-forcement learning (MADRL) based dynamic trajectory planning algorithm. The algorithm leverages the advantages of both the QMIX and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) techniques. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract={The range of applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could be widened if a team of multiple UAVs are used. In this paper, we propose a framework of a team of UAVs with the aim of cooperatively finding a target in a real-world based environment with obstacles. Examples of such applications include search and rescue, remote sensing or infrastructure inspection, which can benefit from an efficient and cooperative multi-UAV system. The framework presented in this paper is modified and extended based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to suit the decentralised multi-agent system while considering the necessary uncertainties of environments and localisations. In addition, the team can cooperate efficiently by sharing limited observation in the mission. We simulated the system in Gazebo simulator and tested the performances for an increased number of UAVs in a cluttered flying area. Results indicate that a POMDP formulation allows for uncertainty in observations and multi-agent navigation and target finding can be implemented in a real-time application in real-world based scenarios.},
