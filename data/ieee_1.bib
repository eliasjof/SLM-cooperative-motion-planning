  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in multi-UAV collaborative search systems, need to realize adaptive autonomous trajectory planning based on their own state and surrounding environmental conditions. To allow for a fast trajectory planning of multiple UAVs from the current state to the target state, this paper proposes a trajectory planning method for multi-UAV collaborative search tasks based on genetic algorithm (GA). And using genetic algorithm, the UAV's trajectory can be optimized online based on the current mission. Through the analysis of the tasks of the multi-UAV collaborative decision-making part and the autonomous trajectory planning part, the genetic algorithm is used to model and optimize the trajectory planning problem to obtain a feasible and efficient optimal search trajectory from the current state to the decision-making target state. Finally, through specific simulation experiments, the optimal trajectory from the current state to the target state of the UAV i in the multi-UAV system is obtained, which verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract={Existing solutions for collaborative trajectory planning using multiple UAVs suffer from issues such as low accuracy, instability, and slow convergence. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces a new method for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 3D terrain cooperative trajectory planning based on the cuckoo search golden jackal optimization (CS-GJO) algorithm. A model for single UAV trajectory planning and a model for multi-UAV collaborative trajectory planning have been developed, and the problem of solving the models is restructured into an optimization problem. Building upon the original golden jackal optimization, the use of tent chaotic mapping aids in the generation of the golden jackal's initial population, thereby promoting population diversity. Subsequently, the position update strategy of the cuckoo search algorithm is combined for purpose of update the position information of individual golden jackals, effectively preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in local minima. Finally, the corresponding nonlinear control parameter were developed. The new parameters expedite the decrease in the convergence factor during the pre-exploration stage, resulting in an improved overall search speed of the algorithm. Moreover, they attenuate the decrease in the convergence factor during the post-exploration stage, thereby enhancing the algorithm's global search. The experimental results demonstrate that the CS-GJO algorithm efficiently and accurately accomplishes multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning in a 3D environment. Compared with other comparative algorithms, the CS-GJO algorithm also has better stability, higher optimization accuracy, and faster convergence speed.},

  abstract={To address the challenges of multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning in three-dimensional complex environments, this study proposes a method based on the Improved Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm for Multi-UAV 3D Trajectory Planning. The approach simulates real geographical environments, establishing three-dimensional terrain and no-fly zone models. Building upon the foundation of single UAV trajectory planning, the proposed method incorporates collaborative constraints for multi-UAV coordination, forming an evaluation function for multi-UAV collaborative trajectory planning. In order to solve the limitations of the standard Grey Wolf Algorithm, which is prone to local optima and exhibits suboptimal convergence rates, an improved convergence factor strategy and a reward-penalty mechanism in the optimization process are introduced. Comparative evaluations against several relevant algorithms validate the superior feasibility of the proposed approach. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to other algorithms, the proposed method achieves smaller trajectory costs, faster convergence rates, and more stable performance.},

  abstract={The recent progress in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) technology has significantly advanced UAV-based applications for military, civil, and commercial domains. Nevertheless, the challenges of establishing high-speed communication links, flexible control strategies, and developing efficient collaborative decision-making algorithms for a swarm of UAVs limit their autonomy, robustness, and reliability. Thus, a growing focus has been witnessed on collaborative communication to allow a swarm of UAVs to coordinate and communicate autonomously for the cooperative completion of tasks in a short time with improved efficiency and reliability. This work presents a comprehensive review of collaborative communication in a multi-UAV system. We thoroughly discuss the characteristics of intelligent UAVs and their communication and control requirements for autonomous collaboration and coordination. Moreover, we review various UAV collaboration tasks, summarize the applications of UAV swarm networks for dense urban environments and present the use case scenarios to highlight the current developments of UAV-based applications in various domains. Finally, we identify several exciting future research direction that needs attention for advancing the research in collaborative UAVs.},

  pages={21492-21504},
  abstract={This work investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted IoT system, where a UAV flies to each foothold to collect data from IoT devices, and then return to its start point. For such a system, we aim to minimize the energy consumption by jointly optimizing the deployment and flight trajectory of UAV. It is a mixed-integer non-convex and NP-hard problem. In order to address it, a bilevel optimization approach is proposed, where an upper-level method aims to optimize the deployment of UAV and a lower-level one aims to plan UAV flight trajectory. Specifically, the former optimizes the number and locations of footholds of UAV. This work proposes an improved dandelion algorithm with a novel encoding strategy, in which each dandelion represents a foothold of UAV and the entire dandelion population is seen as an entire deployment. Then, two mutation strategies are designed to adjust the number and locations of footholds. Based on the footholds of the UAV provided by the former, the latter transforms flight trajectory planning into a traveling salesman problem (TSP). This work proposes an iterated greedy algorithm to solve it efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed bilevel optimization approach is verified on ten instances, and the experimental results show that it significantly outperforms other benchmark approaches.},

  abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of rapid generation of trajectories with time coordination in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formations in complex urban environments. Aiming at the phenomenon that large-scale UAV system trajectory planning is computationally burdensome and fails to generate high time-optimal cooperative trajectories, we propose a time cooperative trajectory planning algorithm based on distributed model predictive control (DMPC). Firstly, a multi-UAV dynamics model based on predictive horizon is established, and a rolling iterative optimization strategy is proposed to ensure the real-time and rapidity of trajectory planning. Furthermore, the time cooperative strategy is proposed so that the UAV formation can arrive at the target position and complete the formation flight mission at the same time to ensure the feasibility of macroscopic task allocation. The simulation results show that the UAV can reach the target location smoothly in the complex environment with random assignment of obstacles, and there is no collision during the flight process, which verifies the reliability of the algorithm.},

  abstract={Aerialplatform-based network has been invoked as an appealing assistance for terrestrial cellular networks. Caching at edge UAVs is an effective emerging solution for relieving the wireless backhaul congestion and reducing content fetching latency for hotspot areas. This article investigates a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled multi-UAV collaborative caching network, where the multimedia contents are delivered from UAVs to ground users. UAVs cache popular contents and collaboratively share with each other. The optimization problem of joint caching decision, 3D trajectory planning and spectrum resource allocation is formulated for minimizing the system content retrieving delay. It is an NP-hard mixed integer nonconvex optimization issue with extra difficulty that the content popularity is highly dynamic. To tackle this challenging problem, we decouple the original issue into two subproblems: (1) UAV collaborative caching decision making and (2) joint optimization of UAV trajectory planning, power allocation, and channel reusing. We develop a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm for the former to achieve the maximum weighted content hit ratio and propose a matching-DRL solution for the latter. Numerical evaluations confirm that the proposed approach is capable of rapid convergence and achieves superior performance in terms of content hit ratio, content retrieving delay, and system throughput compared to other benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract={Multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning faces issues such as model establishment difficulty and a considerable amount of computation. This work proposes a distributed hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) technique. A nonlinear time-varying PSO (NTVPSO) is developed to update the velocity and position of the PSO, aiming at the difficult balance of exploration and exploitation search for PSO. An adaptive DE (ADE) is proposed in order to improve the information sharing between particles and the algorithm's convergence speed. In order to realize the collaborative planning of multiple UAVs, a distributed method is used to solve the single UAV trajectory planning task by using NTVPSO-ADE. The trace is fed back to the PSO velocity update formula to guide the direction of particle movement. The simulation results show that the algorithm is highly competitive in terms of path optimality and can be used as a viable alternative to solve multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning problems.},

This paper considers the use of UAVs to covertly and collaboratively eavesdrop on suspicious wireless transmitters on the ground. We focus on the trajectory planning of the UAVs. To avoid the UAVs being visually noticed by the ground transmitters, we propose a new measure to quantify the disguising performance of the UAVs. The trajectories of the UAVs are planned to maximize the disguising performance, subject to an uninterrupted eavesdropping requirement, UAV collision avoidance and UAV aeronautic maneuverability. A new randomized method based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) is developed to efficiently construct the trajectories of the UAVs. Computer simulations confirm that the proposed method outperforms the random movement method in eavesdropping performance, while achieving with comparable disguising performance.},

  abstract={This study aims to minimize the energy consumption of user equipments (UE) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems through the optimization of UAV flight trajectories, user associations, and resource allocations. The problem is formally articulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. However, employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address this challenge introduces computational complexity and convergence obstacles. In response to these challenges, we propose an efficient and robust approach known as spiking reinforcement trajectory planning (SRTP), which uniquely integrates spiking neural networks (SNN) with DRL. SRTP utilizes a Poisson encoding mechanism to seamlessly convert between spike and continuous signals, enabling collaborative learning between spike actor networks and deep critic networks. Additionally, a pseudo-spacetime backpropagation method is employed for accelerated training of the spike actor network. Experimental findings distinctly highlight SRTP’s advantages, demonstrating a more streamlined network structure and faster convergence compared to conventional methodologies. This innovative methodology holds promise in addressing the computational complexities and convergence challenges associated with implementing DRL in UAV-assisted MEC systems.},

  abstract={In many delay-sensitive monitoring and surveillance applications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can act as edge servers in the air to coordinate with base stations (BSs) for in-situ data collection and processing to achieve real-time situation awareness. In order to ensure the long-term freshness requirements of situation awareness, a swarm of UAVs need to fly frequently among different sensing regions. However, nonstop flying and data processing may quickly drain the batteries armed in UAVs, hence an energy-efficient algorithm for UAVs' dynamic trajectory planning as well as proper data offloading decision is highly desirable. To better model the problem, we propose a freshness function based on the concept of Age-of-Information to express the freshness of situation awareness. We adopt a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with global-local rewards to solve the established continuous online decision-making problem involving many UAVs for achieving efficient collaborative control. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve the most efficient performance compared to six other baselines, i.e., our algorithm is able to significantly reduce the energy consumption while keeping the global situation awareness at a very fresh level under the fast changing environmental dynamics.},

  abstract={In a multi-agent environment, efficient collaborative search among multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for area search and path planning. Therefore, it is important to consider the collaborative learning among UAVs when designing collaborative strategies. This paper analyzes the problems of existing value-decomposition-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in multi-UAV area search and path planning, namely the underestimation of optimal joint actions, which leads to suboptimal policy generation. Subsequently, a new non-monotonicity value-decomposition algorithm is proposed based on the addition of a masked highway connection strategy. This algorithm suppresses the optimization of certain action pairs and focuses more on the optimal joint actions, thus better optimizing the objective and recovering the value of optimal joint actions. Multiple simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve improved performance in environments involving UAV swarms and enhance the collaborative effectiveness of UAV swarms in search tasks.},

  abstract={In this paper, the key elements in the path planning problem of cooperative tower inspection between vehicle and vehicle-mounted unmanned aerial vehicle are sorted out and analyzed, and a model of TSP-D variant problem is constructed. Firstly, the respective functions of UAV and vehicle in the inspection process should be defined, and their respective flight and driving rules should be defined according to the characteristics of their functions. On this basis, the cooperative mode between them and the path characteristics under cooperative constraints should be further considered. The TSP-D model for transmission tower inspection (TTI-TSP-D) is constructed by reducing time consumption through collaborative parallelism and taking the total time required for inspection as the objective function. Therefore, we use genetic algorithm to solve the above model. By analyzing the characteristics of cooperative path planning problems and models, we propose odd-even layered coding to realize the transformation from problem space to chromosome space, and design matching crossover mode, mutation mode, solution test and infeasible solution correction mode. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is analyzed from multiple angles through simulation experiments, The correctness of the algorithm is verified by comparing it with enumeration algorithm in small-scale test cases, and the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with conventional strategies in different scale tests. In addition, in order to improve the solution effect of the algorithm, the sensitivity of related parameters of the algorithm is analyzed through experiments, and the best configuration of algorithm parameters is given.},

  abstract={Communication relay is necessary for a swarm of collaborative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) executing missions in a large area, such as cooperative exploration, mapping tasks and so on, which assists for the quality of transmission in the swarm network. However, it remains a challenge to plan the mission of Relay UAVs (RUs) to enhance communication of the swarm considering the kinematics of UAVs and task sequences of a swarm. This paper proposes a two-layer relay planning framework for a fixed-wing UAV swarm consisting of coarse planning at the Ground Control Station (GCS) as well as refined trajectory planning onboard. The GCS planning layer evaluates the relay requirements in the swarm network to generate the initial deployment of RUs, aiming to minimize their numbers while maximizing utility. The $\beta$-weak connectivity model is adopted to evaluate the swarm network topology constructed from the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Meanwhile, a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Problem (MINLP) is employed to determine the initial deployment of RUs including the number and accessing locations. Moreover, the onboard planning layer predicts the states of the Mission UAVs (MUs) connected to the RU using the Kalman filter. Based on these predictions, the trajectories of each RU are autonomously planned online to continuously guarantee stable network connectivity, which is achieved through Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC). Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={In Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm applications there is a need for autonomous mapping and route planning. These applications include collaborative crop monitoring, aerial transportation, offshore delivery, facility monitoring, disaster relieve as well as search and rescue. Current UAV operations are heavily dependent on human operators that require each UAV to be controlled by a dedicated safety pilot as well as a separate payload operator which limits the efficient use of UAVs required in swarm applications. There is thus an imperative to mature mapping and path planning technologies to allow UAV swarm operations. This paper explores mapping and path planning strategies that allow higher levels of autonomy for a UAV swarm to operate reliably. In this work we developed novel strategies to facilitate swarm mapping, and swarm path planning. The methods developed can be easily scaled to adapt to different UAV swarm sizes. The developed strategies are implemented and tested using simulations. Results and conclusions drawn from these simulation experiments are presented.},

  abstract={In this paper, multi-UAVs serve as mobile aerial ISAC platforms to sense and communicate with on-ground target users. To optimize the communication and sensing performance, we formulate a joint user association, UAV trajectory planning and power allocation problem to maximize the minimum weighted spectral efficiency among UAVs. This paper exploits the centralized and the decentralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solutions to solve the sequential decision-making problem. On one hand, we first introduce the centralized soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Then, we explore the equivalent transformation of the optimization objective based on symmetric group, propose the random and the adaptive data augmentation schemes to design the replay memory buffer of SAC, and accordingly propose SAC algorithms assisted by data augmentation to tackle the transformed problem. On the other hand, the multi-agent soft actor-critic (MASAC), a decentralized solution, is also introduced to solve this sequential decision-making problem. The experiment results reveal the effectiveness of the centralized and the decentralized solutions in considered scenarios. Specifically, the SAC assisted by the adaptive scheme significantly outperforms other centralized solutions in the training speed and the weighted spectral efficiency. Meanwhile, the decentralized MASAC algorithm behaves best in the early training speed.},

  abstract={Mission-oriented drone networks have been widely used for structural inspection, disaster monitoring, border surveillance, etc. Due to the limited battery capacity of drones, mission execution strategy impacts network performance and mission completion. However, collaborative execution is a challenging problem for drones in such a dynamic environment as it also involves efficient trajectory design. We leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to manage the challenge in this study, letting each drone learn to collaboratively execute tasks and plan trajectories based on its current status and environment. Simulation results show that the proposed collaborative execution model can successfully complete the mission at least 80% of the time, regardless of task locations and lengths, and can even achieve a 100% success rate when the task density is not way too sparse. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the pioneer studies on leveraging MARL on collaborative execution for mission-oriented drone networks; the unique value of this work lies in drone battery level driving our model design.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are growingly used in different aspects of our lives. As the cost of UAVs is decreasing with novel technologies, their popularity is increasing rapidly in surveillance, disaster management, agriculture, military operations, etc. The recent trend of collaborative operations of a network of UAVs to achieve a common objective has attracted the researchers as well as commercial vendors. It has revolutionized the means of data collection to maximize mission performances. However, the collaborative UAVs, with respect to the mission objective, need to be resilient to the unavailability of one or more UAVs that can be caused due to cyberattacks or technical failures. As UAVs can easily be targeted by adversaries, these devices need to maintain safe communication with each other while avoiding fuel outage and mid-air collisions, thus reducing the possibilities of being hacked but remain undetected. In this work, we present a formal framework that takes different UAV parameters in a UAV network, resiliency requirements, and resource constraints as the input, and verifies for the resiliency threats. Each threat specifies if k or less number of UAVs fail, whether the rest of the network still can maintain successful communication. We illustrate the execution of this framework with an example case study. We evaluate the proposed framework to demonstrate the relationships between different parameters of a network and its resiliency. We also evaluate the framework in terms of the resiliency analysis performance and scalability.},

  abstract={The intelligent collaborative execution of tasks by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters has received an increasing attention. However, the quality of communication among UAVs cannot be guaranteed in dynamic environments, which hinders real-time information exchange among UAVs within the UAV cluster and results in poor cluster performance. In order to solve this problem, a joint task assignment and trajectory planning problem is studied under the practically limited communication among UAVs while avoiding collisions. It is a complex combinatorial optimization problem and challenging to solve. An intelligently joint task assignment and trajectory planning with limited communication (ITATP-LC) scheme based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is proposed, which can be used to compensate for the lack of observation information of UAVs with limited communication. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can enable UAV clusters to make good collaborative decisions, and has greater effectiveness and adaptability compared to other benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={Low-latency data delivery in sparse deployment scenarios is a challenging problem. The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) provides a viable path to solve this problem. In the existing UAV-assisted IoT system, UAVs usually complete data collection through task collaboration, but there is no data relay transmission between UAVs. The main bottleneck of this mode is that the UAV responsible for the edge region of the ground sensor network needs to fly a long distance to send data to the base station, which will seriously affect the age of information (AoI) performance of the system. Therefore, in this work, we design a UAV-assisted IoT data collection mechanism based on an aerial collaborative relay and propose an AoI-sensitive data collection (ADC) scheme. In this scheme, we design a generalized AoI expectation (GAE) function to achieve iterative optimization of UAV flight paths. Extensive experimental results have shown that the proposed data collection scheme requires less deployment preparation time while obtaining better AoI performance than existing data collection schemes.},

  pages={546-558},
  abstract={This paper is concerned with path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying through low altitude urban environment. Although many different path planning algorithms have been proposed to find optimal or near-optimal collision-free paths for UAVs, most of them either do not consider dynamic obstacle avoidance or do not incorporate multiple objectives. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective path planning (MOPP) framework to explore a suitable path for a UAV operating in a dynamic urban environment, where safety level is considered in the proposed framework to guarantee the safety of UAV in addition to travel time. To this aim, two types of safety index maps (SIMs) are developed first to capture static obstacles in the geography map and unexpected obstacles that are unavailable in the geography map. Then an MOPP method is proposed by jointly using offline and online search, where the offline search is based on the static SIM and helps shorten the travel time and avoid static obstacles, while the online search is based on the dynamic SIM of unexpected obstacles and helps bypass unexpected obstacles quickly. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework under the dynamic urban environment.},

This interface employs Microsoft's HoloLens 2 to allow users to draw paths for drone navigation in 3D using hand gestures. Users can place waypoints with a simple pinch gesture, and similarly, delete and move existing waypoints. To validate paths, we leverage the HoloLens spatial map to check for potential collisions ahead of time, greatly reducing the likelihood of a collision during drone navigation. Paths are simplified and cleaned up using density-based clustering to prevent complex or redundant drone movement. In this Late-Breaking Report, we present the design and implementation of our system that integrates mixed reality, natural hand gestures, and drone path planning, which we plan to evaluate in a user study in the near future.},

  abstract={The trajectory planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the core of efficient UAV mission execution. Existing studies have mainly transformed this problem into a single-objective optimization problem using a single metric to evaluate multi-UAV trajectory planning methods. However, multi-UAV trajectory planning evolves into a many-objective optimization problem due to the complexity of the demand and the environment. Therefore, a multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning model based on many-objective optimization is proposed to optimize trajectory distance, trajectory time, trajectory threat, and trajectory coordination distance costs of UAVs. The NSGA-III algorithm, which overcomes the problems of traditional trajectory planning, is used to solve the model. This paper also designs a segmented crossover strategy and introduces dynamic crossover probability in the crossover operator to improve the solving efficiency of the model and accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning algorithm, thereby addressing different actual needs.},

  abstract={The ability to control a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with minimal human intervention open new areas for autonomous UAV and drone applications. These applications include collaborative crop monitoring, aerial transportation, offshore delivery, facility monitoring, disaster relieve as well as search and rescue. Current UAV operations are heavily dependent on human operators that require each UAV to be controlled by dedicated safety pilot as well as a separate payload operator which limits the efficient use of UAVs required in envisaged swarm applications. Thus, there is an imperative to mature high autonomy guidance and navigation technologies to allow UAV swarm operations. This paper explores UAV swarm navigation and control strategies that allow higher levels of autonomy for a reliable UAV swarm operation. This paper presented the novel strategies developed in performing simultaneous swarm mapping, swarm search, and swarm path planning. The methods developed can be easily scaled up or down to adapt to different number of UAVs in a swarm for any application. The developed strategies are implemented and tested with Monte-Carlo simulations for a search and rescue type mission. The results from these simulation experiments have shown comparable achievements on the performance and robustness when compared to optimal control strategy.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are one of the most rapidly developing, highest level and most practical applied unmanned aerial systems. Collision avoidance and trajectory planning are the core areas of any UAV system. However, there are theoretical and practical problems associated with the existing methods. To manage these problems, this paper presents an optimized artificial potential field (APF) algorithm for multi-UAV operation in 3-D dynamic space. The classic APF algorithm is restricted to single UAV trajectory planning and usually fails to guarantee the avoidance of collisions. To overcome this challenge, a method is proposed with a distance factor and jump strategy to solve common problems, such as unreachable targets, and ensure that the UAV will not collide with any obstacles. The method considers the UAV companions as dynamic obstacles to realize collaborative trajectory planning. Furthermore, the jitter problem is solved using the dynamic step adjustment method. Several resolution scenarios are illustrated. The method has been validated in quantitative test simulation models and satisfactory results were obtained in a simulated urban environment.},

  abstract={In the space–air–ground integrated emergency communication network, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become ideal candidates for expanding traditional base stations through the air–ground Line of Sight (LoS) link, providing more comprehensive and efficient support for emergency communication. To ensure timely information transmission among all the ground users (GUs) involved in rescue, utilizing fair communication can reduce communication conflicts caused by resource competition and ensure that the GUs can obtain the necessary communication resources to improve rescue efficiency. Therefore, this article investigates the joint optimization of trajectory planning and communication design of multiple UAV base stations (UAV-BSs), as well as the access control of GUs in intelligent collaborative air–ground communication systems. The optimization problem is modeled as a hybrid cooperative competition model, where GUs compete for limited UAV-BS resources to maximize their own long-term throughput, while UAV-BSs collaborate to provide maximum fair throughput for GUs in need. This model belongs to heterogeneous agent collaboration, where the goals of GUs and UAV-BSs are inconsistent, and the UAV-BS has inconsistent goals at different stages with or without GU requests. Therefore, a trajectory planning and communication design algorithm for intelligent collaborative air–ground communication (TPCD-ICAGC) algorithm is designed. By introducing a multihead attention mechanism to quickly determine the target correlation with other agents in a complex state space, so as to improve the adaptability of agents to the model and make more effective decisions. The simulation results show that TPCD-ICAGC outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of the fair communication services of UAV-BSs and the accumulative throughput of GUs.},

  abstract={Most research regarding multi-target, multi-base, and multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) coordinated combat mission planning faces the problems of ignoring heterogeneous UAVs, as well as poor task allocation and trajectory planning coupling. To solve these problems, based on air maneuver combat mission backgrounds, the present paper provided a heterogeneous multi-UAV cooperative mission planning method in the complex three-dimensional (3D) mountain environment. In the present paper, based on the Life-cycle Swarm Optimization (LSO) algorithm, varying the number of individuals in the population was utilized to improve the algorithm and further combined with the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm to obtain an optimized path. Then, an improved algorithm was utilized for task allocation and trajectory optimization, and the number and speed of drones dispatched by each base were determined regarding time coordination. Finally, a simulation experiment was conducted. Numerical simulation results showed that the following algorithm was compared with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) when considering radar threats and solid obstacle areas. This has good approximation and high convergence accuracy, and it was effectively utilized in the planning of UAV collaborative missions in 3D complex terrain environments.},

  abstract={This paper mainly solves an online path planning problem of messenger UAV in an air-ground collaborative system which is composed of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) and multiple unmanned ground vehicles(UGVs). The UGVs play the role of mobile actuators, while the UAV acts as a messenger to transmit the information among the UGVs. The online path planning problem for the messenger UAV can be modeled as a Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DDTSP). The goal of this problem is to find a shortest path which enables the UAV to access all UGVs periodically. This paper proposes an online path planning method based on heuristic rules. The method can be divided into two stages: firstly, the sequence for the UAV to access the UGVs are determined by the heuristic rules which consider the relative positions and movement characteristics of the UGVs and the UAV, and then the access positions of the UAV are determined. Computational results on instances with varying characteristics show that the proposed method can generate high-quality solutions in a very short time. The comparison experiments demonstrate that, compared with another advanced method, our method can achieve a better balance between the quality of the solution and time consumption.},

  abstract={This article investigates the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered sensor networks (WPSNs), where UAVs simultaneously collect data and transfer energy to the sensor nodes (SNs). Our main objective is to reduce the average age of information (AoI) and extend the lifetime of the sensor network. To achieve this, we propose a collaborative UAV-enabled WPSN architecture. Within this architecture, UAVs can send data to the base station (BS) through the air-to-air relay links. To achieve air-to-air transmission between UAVs, we propose an AoI-energy-aware UAV data collection (AEADC) scheme. In this scheme, we first select convergence nodes (CNs) and divide the mission regions for the sensor network to address the mission allocation problem for UAVs. Next, we establish relay relationships between UAVs and construct the shortest relay transmission links to determine which UAVs relay data to other UAVs. Finally, we jointly optimize UAV flight paths and hovering time to achieve seamless data transmission among UAVs. Through extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively reduces the average AoI of the system and extends the lifetime of the sensor network.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly applied to surveillance tasks, thanks to their excellent mobility and flexibility. Different from existing works using UAVs for video surveillance, this paper employs a UAV team to carry out collaborative radio surveillance on ground moving nodes and disguise the purpose of surveillance. We consider two aspects of disguise. The first is that the UAVs do not communicate with each other (or the ground nodes can notice), and each UAV plans its trajectory in a decentralized way. The other aspect of disguise is that the UAVs avoid being noticed by the nodes for which a metric quantifying the disguising performance is adopted. We present a new decentralized method for the online trajectory planning of the UAVs, which maximizes the disguising metric while maintaining uninterrupted surveillance and avoiding UAV collisions. Based on the model predictive control (MPC) technique, our method allows each UAV to separately estimate the locations of the UAVs and the ground nodes, and decide its trajectory accordingly. The impact of potential estimation errors is mitigated by incorporating the error bounds into the online trajectory planning, hence achieving a robust control of the trajectories. Computer-based simulation results demonstrate that the developed strategy ensures the surveillance requirement without losing disguising performance, and outperforms existing alternatives. Note to Practitioners—The paper is motivated by the covertness requirement in the radio surveillance (also called eavesdropping) by UAVs. In some situations, the UAV user (such as the police department) wishes to disguise the surveillance intention from the targets, and the trajectories of UAVs play a significant role in the disguising. However, the typical UAV trajectories such as standoff tracking and orbiting can easily be noticed by the targets. Considering this gap, we focus on how to plan the UAVs’ trajectories so that they are less noticeable while conducting effective eavesdropping. We formulate a path planning problem aiming at maximizing a disguising metric, which measures the magnitude of the relative position change between a UAV and a target. A decentralized method is proposed for the online trajectory planning of the UAVs based on MPC, and its robust version is also presented to account for the uncertainty in the estimation and prediction of the nodes’ states.},

And we consider the block density and continuous monitoring while planning the trajectory. Simulation results show that our method improves the accuracy by 26.2% compared with the traditional method in the same environment and using the same number of UAVs. The accuracy of our method reaches 0.95 in 500 seconds in the given environment.},

Therefore, the multi-constraint mixed integer programming models of track planning and cooperative delivery path planning were constructed respectively, and A* algorithm and adaptive large-scale domain search algorithm were used to solve the track planning and path planning models respectively. Firstly, the simulation environment of UAV flight track planning is constructed by using digital elevation data, and the multi-objective flight track planning function is solved by A* algorithm to get the results. Then, the output results of UAV three-dimensional flight track planning, such as distance and energy consumption, were input into the integrated collaborative delivery mode as parameters to provide decision support for the solution process and obtain better solutions. The simulation results show that in the collaborative delivery mode, the navigation distance data obtained by using the three-dimensional flight track planning of UAV is closer to the actual application scene than the traditional Euclidean distance, which increases the practical application value of this mode. The hybrid algorithm can solve the track planning and path planning efficiently and accurately, and has good convergence performance.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been a subject of research for cooperative communication for quite some time. To achieve the highest possible data rates, UAVs must be positioned optimally. For this cooperative communication to be most effective (maximizing data rates), the UAVs' positions and trajectories are critically important. Additionally, the limited onboard power supply, which depletes rapidly, becomes a decisive factor when burdened with transmission loads. In this research, UAV-assisted cooperative communication is explored, with a focus on moving UAVs rather than stationary ones. The objective is to maximize data rates through optimal trajectory planning, from the UAVs' initial positions to their final destinations, and through efficient utilization of onboard power resources. In this scenario, the UAVs harvest energy from the power received from the source and use it for further communication. A Mixed Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP) mathematical model is formulated to address these issues. Additionally, an efficient e-optimal algorithm is proposed, based on the mesh adaptive direct search method.

  abstract={In the realm of autonomous navigation for UGVs, environmental perception serves as a critical component. UGVs frequently encounter complex scenarios where sensory functions may become compromised. This paper addresses the challenges associated with autonomous navigation for UGVs under perception-failure conditions. To facilitate autonomous navigation for UGVs when sensory limitations are present, we propose a framework where an UAV guides the navigation of the UGV. Initially, an optimal guidance viewpoint selection strategy is employed to determine the most advantageous guidance viewpoint for the UAV. This is followed by a front-end path search to identify routes that ensure both the safety of the UAV and the visibility of the UGV. Subsequently, through the application of spatiotemporal trajectory optimization methods, UAV guidance flight trajectories are generated, which involves constructing constraints based on UAV dynamics, flight corridor restrictions, guidance distance parameters, and visibility area limitations, in conjunction with gimbal dynamics constraints and the central field of view stipulation. Moreover, the paper utilizes a UGV target point mapping strategy, projecting UAV state points onto a two-dimensional plane to facilitate UGV target trajectory tracking. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is substantiated through simulation.},

  abstract={Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) cooperative trajectory planning is an extremely challenging issue in UAV research field due to its NP-hard characteristic, collision avoiding constraints, close formation requirement, consensus convergence and high-dimensional action space etc. Especially, the difficulty of multi-UAV trajectory planning will boost comparatively when there are complex obstacles and narrow passages in unknown environments. Accordingly, a novel multi-UAV adaptive cooperative formation trajectory planning approach is proposed in this article based on an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm in unknown obstacle environments, which innovatively introduces long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) into the environment perception end of multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) network, and develops an improved potential field-based dense reward function to strengthen the policy learning efficiency and accelerates the convergence respectively. Moreover, a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning training mechanism, including adaptive formation layer, trajectory planning layer and action execution layer is implemented to explore an optimal trajectory planning policy. Additionally, an adaptive formation maintaining and transformation strategy is presented for UAV swarm to comply with the environment with narrow passages. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is better in policy learning efficiency, optimality of trajectory planning policy and adaptability to narrow passages than that using multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) and MATD3.},

  abstract={Trajectory planning in airborne networks is a primary application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communication. The literature contains algorithms focusing on collision avoidance, intelligent task assignment and path planning among UAVs. Cooperative schemes exist in which the UAVs communicate with each other to reach a consensus on how each vehicle will take up one trajectory at a time efficiently based on its capability. In the last decade, much research is being done to use UAVs to track contamination in the environment, detect fires and even volcanic eruptions. As the plumes are constantly varying in space and time, there have to be efficient guidance algorithms for the UAVs in order to keep track of the shape of the plume. In this paper, we survey the literature to explore the currently available trajectory planning algorithms and also the few available plume tracking algorithms. We then formulate the Plume wrapping problem and propose a cooperative trajectory planning approach for a group of UAVs, through which the UAVs communicate their position estimates and planned trajectories to update each others trajectory to efficiently wrap around a plume region so that the contamination in the region can be studied.},

This has triggered a great deal of research in higher levels of planning and control, including collaborative sensing and exploration, synchronized motion planning, and formation or cooperative control. In this paper, we describe our recently developed experimental testbed at the University of Pennsylvania, which consists of multiple, fixed-wing UAVs. We describe the system architecture, software and hardware components, and overall system integration. We then derive high-fidelity models that are validated with hardware-in-the-loop simulations and actual experiments. Our models are hybrid, capturing not only the physical dynamics of the aircraft, but also the mode switching logic that supervises lower level controllers.

  abstract={In the field of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, there has been a growing interest in the efficient management of energy consumption through strategic path planning in complex obstacle environments. This emerging trend aims to optimize the flight routes of UAVs in order to minimize their energy usage. Path planning is a key process to determine the trajectory of a UAV from its origin to its destination. However, many algorithms proposed for this task have proven to be inefficient in complex obstacle environments. For this reason, this paper proposes a Levy flight based multi-population gray wolf optimization (LM-GWO) algorithm. It combines multi-population ideas, and clusters individual gray wolves into different populations through the Bi-Kmeans clustering algorithm. It accelerates the algorithm’s convergence by allowing different gray wolf populations to complete different jobs during the training process. In addition, one of the limitations of the GWO algorithm is its susceptibility to getting trapped in local optima, which is solved by introducing the Levy flight mechanism, which ultimately makes the multi-UAVs cooperate to complete the path planning work. The results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the LM-GWO algorithm can get the flight path that satisfies the constraints. By comparing with the other three algorithms, the algorithm’s effectiveness in solving cooperative path planning to save energy consumption is verified.},

  abstract={In existing Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, sensor nodes (SNs) are often deployed in wilderness areas to collect environmental data. Due to the lack of infrastructure in these remote areas, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to transfer energy to SNs and collect the data generated by SNs. For areas far from the base station (BS), UAVs need to fly long distances to traverse SNs in those areas and return to the BS. This significantly increases the data transmission delay of the system. How to reduce data transmission delay in wireless-powered IoT is a challenging problem. Therefore, in this study, we propose a data collection mechanism by establishing UAV-to-UAV data relay transmission to reduce data transmission delay. To realize relay transmission between UAVs, we propose a seamless relay-based UAV collaborative scheduling (SRCS) scheme. In this scheme, we first select hover points to ensure that the charging range of UAVs covers all SNs. Next, we divide the task regions and plan paths within each region for UAVs. Then, we establish relay pairing relationships between UAVs to determine which UAVs relay data to others and jointly optimize relay points and hovering time to achieve seamless relay between UAVs. Finally, we achieve energy balance among SNs through reselecting cluster head (CH) nodes and among UAVs through exchanging task regions. Extensive experimental results have shown that the proposed data collection scheme can effectively extend network lifetime and significantly reduce data transmission delay compared with the existing data collection schemes.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle technology has made great progress in the past and is widely used in many fields. However, they are unable to meet large-scale and complex missions with a limited energy reserve. Only multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) work together to better cope with this problem and have been extensively studied. In this paper, a new systematic framework is proposed to solve the problem of multi-UAV collaborative task allocation. It is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved by the improved clustering algorithm. The purpose is to enable multi-UAV to complete tasks with lower energy consumption. As the number of UAVs rises, it also appears the flight safety issues such as collisions among the UAVs, an improved multi-UAV collision-resistant method based on the improved artificial potential field is proposed. Besides, the UAVs connected with the internet are vulnerable to the various type of network attacks, a method based on the intrusion detection system is proposed to resist the network attack during multi-UAV mission execution. We have also proposed an improved method to improve the accuracy of task allocation further. In addition, an online real-time path planning is proposed to enhance the robustness of multi-UAV to cope with sudden problems. Finally, the numerical simulations and real physical flying experiments showed that the proposed method could provide a viable solution for multi-UAV task allocation; moreover, compared with other task allocation methods, our method has great performance.},

  abstract={To solve the shortcomings of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in data collection in a wide range, long distance, and other complex environments, such as high networking cost, short network life cycle, and difficult data collection, a data collection strategy based on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cluster collaborative networking is proposed.

The simulation results verify that the strategy reduces the overall network energy consumption by 42.16% and the total range of UAV by 9.7% and realizes the relative minimization of WSNs energy consumption and UAV flight cost on the premise of ensuring the full coverage of WSNs’ nodes.},

  pages={9782-9795},
  abstract={Owing to the flexibility and low cost, cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs) have been attractive in multi-target positioning recently. Although it is popular and easy to accomplish, positioning based on trilateration method still faces challenges under scenarios with multiple UAVs. First, large accumulated errors will be brought if a single UAV is used to perform trilateration on same targets. Second, due to the mobility of targets, the time interval between UAVs performing twice successive distance measurement on one target cannot be long for positioning precision. Finally, the limited energy provided by onboard battery limits the time for UAVs to perform tasks. Once the energy used by some of the UAVs reaches limitation, the whole positioning mission will fail. Thus, to complete the mission of locating multiple targets, this paper is intended to minimize the maximum energy consumption among all UAVs. We formulate the problem, and decompose it into two subproblems, one of which plans the routes for UAV groups and the other plans the routes for UAVs in a group. To solve the first subproblem, a heuristic algorithm called adjusted genetic algorithm (AGA) is proposed to plan trajectories for all UAV groups under constraints on maximum energy consumption. To guarantee stable performance and reduce computation complexity, we propose an approximation algorithm, Tree Decomposition united with Christofides Algorithm (TDCA), and the approximation ratio is proved to be (3 * N'/(2 * (N' - 1))), where N' denotes the number of UAV groups. For the second subproblem, a two-step greedy heuristic algorithm is proposed to plan trajectories for UAVs in same groups. Extensive simulations show that compared to existing algorithms, the proposed algorithms can reduce up to 26.6% maximum and 26.3% average energy consumption.},

  abstract={Large-scale emergency rescue tasks require search and rescue units to conduct autonomous exploration and to be able to respond quickly in complex and dangerous environments. This paper proposes a ground-aerial collaborative framework for search and rescue scenarios. The heterogeneous collaborative system is composed of a single unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) and a single unmanned ground vehicle(UGV). The UAV is responsible for providing a global topological map of the airspace perspective and performing path planning, and the UGV is responsible for local obstacle avoidance. Collaborative exploration has improved the autonomous exploration capabilities of unmanned systems in large-scale emergency rescue scenarios. This paper proposes a road network extraction and topology construction algorithm based on a airspace perspective image, providing a global traversable map. A path planning algorithm based on the global topological map of airspace is proposed, which improves the efficiency of UGV's exploratory progress. In the real scene experiment, compared with the single UGV with a priori map, the time consumption of GACF is reduced by 59%, which greatly improves the exploration efficiency of the unmanned system in practical applications.},

  abstract={The problem of task allocation of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems is a hot issue in scientific research. Aiming at overcome the shortcomings of existing algorithms in terms of load balancing and execution efficiency, an algorithm Improved Self-Organizing Mapping (ISOM) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, considering the two factors of the UAV flight distance and the mission execution time, the load balance of the UAV is designed. The sum of the track lengths of multiple UAVs and the total time required by multiple UAVs to complete all the tasks in the task area are used to evaluate the quality of cooperative task assignment of multiple UAVs. Secondly, the learning rate and neighborhood function of nonlinear change are designed to ensure the stability and accelerate its convergence. With the increase of the number of iterations, the radius of the neighborhood gradually decreases, and the renewal range of the superior neighborhood is determined by the nonlinear function. Finally, in order to solve the problem of new tasks of UAV and UAV failure, the attention mechanism based on the ISOM algorithm is introduced. Different attention is allocated by the distance between the UAV and the mission points to ensure the missions can be fully executed. Compared with algorithms PSO-GA, Gurobi and ORTools, the time to complete the task is effectively reduced, respectively. At the same time, the algorithm is verified in a large task environment. When the number of tasks is 200 and the number of UAVs is 8, in the TSPLIB task set, the simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency and flexibility of the proposed algorithm.},

Benefiting from its fast and flexible deployment capabilities, UAV swarms have been widely applied to emergency communications. In the event of damaged ground communication base stations, UAV swarms can quickly reconstruct an emer-gency communication network. However, considering the limited coverage power of a single UAV node, it underscores the need for effective coordination among swarm units as well as diligent planning of a coverage trajectory. In this paper, we propose a cooperative intelligence-based UAV swarm approach for establishing emergency communications. We model a multi-UAV base station-assisted emergency communication scenario as a team Markov game model. To achieve cooperative collaboration among multiple UAVs, we propose a Q-function mixing network based coverage trajectory planning algorithm.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)–also known as drones or Unmanned Aircraft–have found diverse applications in various fields owing to their significant advantages, including fast mobility and rapid deployment. UAVs are crucial in aerial networks, providing increased coverage and on-demand connectivity as mobile nodes. In recent years, UAVs have made room to leverage the Internet of Things (IoT) to the sky, enhancing air-to-ground communication and pointing toward the next generation of UAV networks. As this expansion is still in its early stages, there are several aerial network terminologies, each with similarities and differences, depending on the deployment domain and the services they offer. However, studies have yet to discuss these different terminologies consistently. Key aspects have yet to be thoroughly explored, such as the anticipated requirements for deploying these networks and how they relate to the various terminologies.

  abstract={In recent years, a large number of commercial airplanes equipped with sensors have been contributing to collecting the atmospheric composition and meteorological data. Based on a worldwide commercial airplane dataset, we identify an inherent limitation of such an airplane-based sensing system as airplanes fly through airspace with spatiotemporal dynamic. As a result, the sensed data is coarse-grained and incomplete. Moreover, naive methods such as installing sensors on more airplanes, cannot effectively address the issue. In this paper, we propose a collaborative airspace sensing strategy auSense to improve the sensing performance. In auSense, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are employed to sense the airspace when the airspace is not sensed by airplanes. Particularly, auSense leverages the existing worldwide commercial airplane tracking infrastructure and fine-grained trajectory data to estimate whether and when one airspace will be sensed by airplanes. Then auSense schedules the UAV paths to improve the sensing performance. We implement auSense in different airspaces based on a 1-month airplane trajectory data. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our data-driven UAV and commercial airplane collaborative strategy over the ground truth and other benchmarks.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) technology, the application fields of the UAV are becoming more and more wide. Especially in the field of military operations, as a new type of weapon with high cost performance, the application prospect of the UAV in modern war will be very broad. However, due to the complexity of the battlefield environment and the diversity of mission forms, the mission capability that a single UAV can perform is limited and its survivability is also challenged. The mission mode of the UAV has gradually developed from single platform mission execution to swarm collaborative mission execution. As one of the key technologies for multiple UAVs cooperative operations, mission planning technology has received extensive attention. This paper conducts research on the field of UAV swarm mission planning. Firstly, the multi-objective optimization model is established with the goal of the shortest path and the least airborne time for the UAV swarm to complete the mission. Secondly, the above model is optimized with constructing an adaptive genetic algorithm by improving the genetic operator and the crossover operator. Finally, the corresponding algorithm is simulated and analyzed through a specific example.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) consist of a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with edge resources and collaboration with ground-control-servers (GCS) are useful for heavy computation use cases e.g., traffic management, public safety, and disaster response management. Inefficient setups and collaboration decisions, often stemming from edge/cloud network misconfigurations, can lead to suboptimal resource utilization and delayed response times. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for (soft) real-time learning-based UAS-Edge-Server collaboration and orchestration strategies to achieve pertinent allocations of both computation resources and communication strategies. Our approach includes i) policy-based pre-application collaboration and benchmark analysis as well as ii) learning-based multi-agent deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm that optimizes UAV swarm trajectories during application. Evaluation results demonstrate that our policy-based approach Pareto-optimally trade-off performance (e.g., accuracy, streaming) and disaster response time. In addition, our DQN approach significantly enhances edge-cloud resource cooperation, improving network performance metrics like throughput and round-trip time by a minimum of 12% compared to state-of-the-art edge-internet-of-things (EIoT) collaboration algorithms. Furthermore, through real-world emulations, we illustrate how our orchestration attains 87% of the Oracle baseline network throughput performance while maintaining a comparable disaster response time for various video analytics-based disaster scenarios.},

  abstract={The unparalleled communication and sensing capabilities of the 6th generation (6G) networks can fulfill the diverse requirements of emerging scenarios like the metaverse. However, several issues such as queue transmission between numerous heterogeneous nodes and difficulties in understanding complex and dynamic environments from high-level cognition urgently need to be addressed. In response, this paper proposes an environmental cognition-driven method based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which comprehensively considers node positions, task queues, and frequency conflicts, then optimizing node clustering to cope with complex and dynamic electromagnetic environments. In the meanwhile, to overcome the limitations of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods in addressing the increasing complexities of multi-task and multi-granularity decision-making, a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) method based on the actor-critic (AC) framework is proposed to quick decision-making for air-ground collaborative communication. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed environmental cognition-driven hierarchical decision-making method can reduce redundant interactions among nodes and improve the transmission rate.},

  abstract={Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) cooperative search have been widely adopted for surveillance and search-related applications. For a certain search area, UAVs may need to search it repeatedly to obtain a high-confidence result about the target distribution in the search area. However, the short battery life and moderate computational capability restrict UAVs to repeatedly execute the computation-intensive and energy-consuming search tasks. To address the issue, in this paper, we utilize edge computing to develop a continual and cooperative UAV search mechanism. Specifically, we first establish an edge computing enabled multi-UAV cooperative search framework, in which the mobility model of UAV, search task computing and offloading models are presented. An uncertainty minimization problem is then formulated, aiming to obtain a high-efficiency and high-confidence search result at the unpredictable uncertainty in search area. Considering that round-trip energy consumption, offloading decision-making, and trajectory planning may contribute to the reduction in uncertainty, we propose an uncertainty minimization-based cooperative target search (UMCTS) strategy. Finally, extensive simulation results validate that UMCTS can outperform the existing strategies and achieve at least 89% performance gain on average uncertainty. Based on the results, we also present a comprehensive analysis and discussion on how different parameters affect the search performance.},

  abstract={Aerial edge computing (AEC) networks, which employ multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile-edge computing servers, have emerged as a promising solution to provide computation offloading services, especially in scenarios where the coverage of existing infrastructures is limited for wireless networks. Recently, there has been a growing focus on leveraging UAVs with diverse computing capabilities to enhance the performance of AEC networks through cooperative computing. However, heterogeneity and cooperation introduce a higher degree of coupling between trajectory planning and computing offloading strategy for AEC networks. In particular, the joint decision making in an AEC network needs to balance minimizing the distance between UAVs and access users and enabling collaborative offloading. And this must be done while considering the time-varying computation requirements and the long-term impact on system performance. To address the aforementioned challenges, we formulate an optimization problem to design a joint dynamic cooperative computation offloading and trajectory optimization scheme for the AEC network. The complexity arises from the problem’s nature as a mixed-integer nonlinear program. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on QMIX. We leverage both theoretical analysis and an action branching architecture to reduce the complexity of our proposed deep reinforcement algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate a substantial performance improvement over the benchmarks, affirming the effectiveness of our complexity reduction approach.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless networks have received increasing research interest in recent years and are gradually being utilized in various aspects of our society. The growing complexity of UAV applications such as disaster management, plant protection, and environment monitoring, has resulted in escalating and stringent requirements for UAV networks that a single UAV cannot fulfill. To address this, multi-UAV wireless networks (MUWNs) have emerged, offering enhanced resource-carrying capacity and enabling collaborative mission completion by multiple UAVs. However, the effective operation of MUWNs necessitates a higher level of autonomy and intelligence, particularly in decision-making and multi-objective optimization under diverse environmental conditions. Reinforcement Learning (RL), an intelligent and goal-oriented decision-making approach, has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the intricate tasks associated with MUWNs. As one may notice, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in RL-based MUWNs. Thus, this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive review of RL-based approaches in the context of autonomous MUWNs. We present an informative overview of RL and demonstrate its application within the framework of MUWNs. Specifically, we summarize various applications of RL in MUWNs, including data access, sensing and collection, resource allocation for wireless connectivity, UAV-assisted mobile edge computing, localization, trajectory planning, and network security. Furthermore, we identify and discuss several open challenges based on the insights gained from our review.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAVs) swarm has great advantage over traditional equipment in cooperative detection scenario for its easy-maneuverability, no human injury and low cost, etc. As a representative task in cooperative detection, region coverage has widely applications in environmental monitoring, search and rescue, etc. In UAV cooperative detection tasks, the most critical step is task planning, which has direct impact on the overall detection performance. The target of task planning is to generate planned actions and flight route for UAVs to complete specific detection task according to UAV swarm locations, sensor ability, task region, etc. However, traditional task planning methods for UAV cooperative detection that based on evolutionary computing or reinforcement learning always need plenty of time for getting planning results. In this paper, we proposed a top-down task planning algorithm based on greedy policy to tackle this problem. The core idea of the proposed method lies in that we choose optimal detection trace from all trace candidates during each planning step in a greedy manner via a predefined performance indicator. Moreover, we also proposed a simple but effective procedure for generate detection trace candidates by corner points and nearest border points extraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments for the representative swarm detection task region coverage. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and superiority over traditional methods on task planning speed.},

  abstract={Researchers have designed UAV-enabled edge servers (UES) to assist smart cameras (ECs) and optimize video analytics performance. However, most prior research neglects the impact of ECs' battery constraint on the system performance, especially in disaster scenarios. In this study, we introduce a novel time-slot-based UES-assisted system that aims to conserve energy and extend the overall lifetime of EC networks. Our proposed system operates in discrete time slots, wherein the UES alternates between hovering and serving ECs, or flying to a new position within its coverage area to provide better assistance. To minimize the computational overhead of ECs during hovering and serving within a time slot, we present a new task offloading scheme based on the differential evolutionary algorithm. For optimizing the UES's flying trajectory, we formulate the UES movement as a Markov decision process, taking into account system state changes. Subsequently, we design an efficient UES trajectory planning algorithm using double deep Q-learning. This algorithm optimizes energy consumption, feedback reward, and the overall system overhead, resulting in a doubling of the system's lifetime. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed task offloading algorithm exhibits high accuracy and fast convergence compared to four other state-of-the-art strategies. Moreover, the UES trajectory planning algorithm doubles the system's lifetime while reducing energy consumption and total system overhead.},

Four differential evolution operators are used to construct a pool of candidate operators to improve the optimization efficiency. Dynamic Thompson sampling is employed to learn the expected returns of the operators. DE-DYTS is tested in three scenarios to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency, and the results are statistically analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

  abstract={In the Internet of Connected Vehicles, caching content frequently requested by users on edge devices can reduce access latency. Particularly in high-traffic density areas, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can integrate into future cellular networks to enhance the network capacity and meet increased requests. Therefore, we formulate a joint optimization problem of cooperative caching of Base Station (BS) and UAVs and UAV trajectory planning to minimize network latency while considering the limited energy and storage capacity and dynamic vehicles. First, we propose a Temporal-evolving Bipartite Graph Neural Networks (TBGN) model for traveling areas prediction of vehicles. Then, regarding the coupling of optimization variables, we propose an Energy-aware Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to optimize the UAV’s service trajectory by predicted spatio-temporal vehicle density. Finally, the optimization problem degenerates into a monotonic submodular function to optimize caching decisions. We utilize real vehicle trajectories for simulations. The results show that the TBGN outperforms other advanced models in terms of mobility prediction accuracy by 7.4%, and the proposed scheme reduces average latency by 16% compared to other schemes.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is a promising solution for providing high-quality mobile services (e.g., edge computing, fast Internet connection, and local caching) to ground users, where a UAV with limited service coverage travels among multiple geographical user locations (e.g., hotspots) for servicing their demands locally. How to dynamically determine a UAV swarm's cooperative path planning to best meet many users’ spatio-temporally distributed demands is an important question but is unaddressed in the literature. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to design and analyze cooperative path planning algorithms of a large UAV swarm for optimally servicing many spatial locations, where ground users’ demands are released dynamically in the long time horizon. Regarding a single UAV's path planning design, we manage to substantially simplify the traditional dynamic program and propose an optimal algorithm of low computation complexity, which is only polynomial with respect to both the numbers of spatial locations and user demands. After coordinating a large number $K$K of UAVs, this simplified dynamic optimization problem becomes intractable and we alternatively present a fast iterative cooperation algorithm with provable approximation ratio $1-(1-\frac{1}{K})^{K}$1-(1-1K)K in the worst case, which is proved to obviously outperform the traditional approach of partitioning UAVs to serve different location clusters separately. To relax UAVs’ battery capacity limit for sustainable service provisioning, we further allow UAVs to travel to charging stations in the mean time and thus jointly design UAVs’ path planning over users’ locations and charging stations. Despite of the problem difficulty, for the optimal solution, we successfully transform the problem to an integer linear program by creating novel directed acyclic graph of the UAV-state transition diagram, and propose an iterative algorithm with constant approximation ratio. Finally, we validate the theoretical results by extensive simulations.},

  abstract={This paper investigates a three-tier architecture edge computing network assisted by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the context of 6G. To address the issue of insufficient freshness of information during the offloading process for latency-sensitive computing tasks, we propose a hybrid strategy-based multi-agent collaborative algorithm (HSMAC). Minimizing the average age of information (AoI) in the system is set as the optimization objective and solved within the actor-critic framework. By integrating local observations from various data sources, edge buffering, and offloading conditions, the algorithm learns UAV trajectory planning and data scheduling. Additionally, a novel federated learning algorithm (FL) is introduced to enable multiple agents to share experiences. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively handles system heterogeneity and outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of performance.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been significant progress in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology. UAVs have undergone significant advancements, becoming increasingly mature with improved maneuverability, ease of operation, and cost-effectiveness. As a result, UAVs have emerged as a vital tool in various domains, including intelligence reconnaissance and target search. In contrast to single UAV systems, the utilization of UAV formations or clusters has gained prominence as an innovative organizational approach, offering significant advantages such as expanded reconnaissance range and enhanced operational effectiveness. This paper initiates by establishing a comprehensive problem model for multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance. Subsequently, we propose novel techniques, including the historical path probability decrease mechanism and the rolling optimization strategy.

  abstract={It is an inspiring way to provide emergence communication services in natural disaster areas by deploying wireless routers on the ground and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the air. The wireless routers serve as access points. UAVs relay data from routers and themselves to a remote base station in a safe place. Thus, people can communicate with others outside the disaster. The network lifetime is restricted to battery lifetime of routers which are scattered over a complex post-disaster area. There is a potential to prolong the network lifetime by utilizing UAV mobility. We consider the trajectory planning of UAVs with the goal of maximizing the network lifetime, which is modeled as a cooperative game with complete information. However, the time complexity of the problem increases exponentially with the number of UAVs as well as UAV candidate strategies. In our proposal, we boost the game process by excluding some of candidates from the strategy space for each UAV. Specifically, there is no influence for a given UAV, taking the strategies excluded, over the other UAVs. In addition, these strategies are dominated by another strategy at least. Our proposed model is verified through simulations that show its advantage on time complexity over others.},

  abstract={With the prosperous development of the Internet of Things (IoT), large numbers of IoT devices have been deployed in many scenarios to perceive the data of surroundings. To provide real-time service, devices prefer to transfer the data to servers for faster processing. However, in some special areas with limited communication infrastructure, devices cannot be directly connected to the Internet, so the requirements of data collection and processing are agnostic, which brings a huge challenge for real-time and dynamic data processing. We make the first attempt to tackle this challenge by proposing an Intelligent Active Data Processing Scheme (IADP) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled edge computing. The main innovations of IADP are as follows: 1) when IoT devices generate or sense data, they can intelligently and proactively spread data or data information to other areas to inform UAV to collect; 2) our scheme combines active data processing with data deadline priority and artificial intelligence (AI)-based UAV trajectory optimization to achieve maximum data processing rate and minimum UAV flight cost. Specifically, genetic algorithm-deadline constraint traveling Salesman problem (GA-DCTSP) algorithm is proposed based on improved GA to achieve it; and 3) an intelligent data processing decision mechanism of optimally determining transmitting to UAV or edge server is proposed to further optimize network performance. Finally, the experimental results show that our proposed IADP increases the data processing rate by 48.77%–232.54% and reduces the UAV flight distance by 63.45%–88.36% compared with the existing schemes.},

  abstract={To prolong the lifetime of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the UAVs need to fulfill their missions in the shortest possible time. In addition to this requirement, in many applications, the UAVs require a reliable internet connection during their flights. In this paper, we minimize the travel time of the UAVs, ensuring that a probabilistic connectivity constraint is satisfied. To solve this problem, we need a global model of the outage probability in the environment. Since the UAVs have different missions and fly over different areas, their collected data carry local information on the network's connectivity. As a result, the UAVs can not rely on their own experiences to build the global model. This issue affects the path planning of the UAVs. To address this concern, we utilize a two-step approach. In the first step, by using Federated Learning (FL), the UAVs collaboratively build a global model of the outage probability in the environment. In the second step, by using the global model obtained in the first step and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs), we propose an algorithm to optimize UAVs' paths. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this two-step approach for UAV networks.},

  abstract={Swarms of aerial drones have recently been considered for last-mile deliveries in urban logistics or automated construction. At the same time, collaborative transportation of payloads by multiple drones is another important area of recent research. However, efficient coordination algorithms for collaborative transportation of many payloads by many drones remain to be considered. In this work, we formulate the collaborative transportation of payloads by a swarm of drones as a novel, under-capacitated generalization of vehicle routing problems (VRP), which may also be of separate interest. In contrast to standard VRP and capacitated VRP, we must additionally consider waiting times for payloads lifted cooperatively by multiple drones, and the corresponding coordination. Algorithmically, we provide a solution encoding that avoids deadlocks and formulate an appropriate alternating minimization scheme to solve the problem. On the hardware side, we integrate our algorithms with collision avoidance and drone controllers. The approach and the impact of the system integration are successfully verified empirically, both on a swarm of real nano-quadcopters and for large swarms in simulation. Overall, we provide a framework for collaborative transportation with aerial drone swarms, that uses only as many drones as necessary for the transportation of any single payload.},

The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid algorithm is more effective than the traditional GA algorithm for performing a global search. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces resource consumption while maintaining the optimality of the trajectory planning route.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to improve the quality of services for the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks. Nevertheless, in the context of multi-access edge computing (MEC), a key pillar for meeting 5G key performance indicators, state-of-the-art design suffers from difficulty in matching time/spatial-varying communication/computation demands with distributed resources in highly dynamic air-ground integrated networks. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a joint online trajectory planning and offloading scheduling scheme based on reinforcement learning (RL), such that a UAV and base stations in a multi-cell network can dynamically and collaboratively offer edge computing services. We formulate the decision-making on trajectory planning/offloading scheduling as mutually embedded Markov decision processes, so as to avoid exponentially increasing joint state/action spaces and non-cooperative decision-making. In order to learn the policies for decision-making, novel RL algorithms are proposed based on deep Q-network and the kernel method, respectively. It is shown that the learned policy is able to make the joint trajectory planning and offloading scheduling adaptive to dynamic computation demands. Benefiting from this, the air-ground collaborative MEC can significantly outperform the terrestrial-only MEC in terms of the average backlog of newly produced computational task bits.},

  abstract={With various consumer electronics deployed in Internet of Vehicles (IoV), human-centric consumer in-vehicle applications (e.g., driver assistance, path planning, and healthcare system) can supply high-quality driving experience and enhance travel safety within a short time. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are expected to be critical to assist terrestrial vehicular networks in delivering delay-sensitive contents of services. However, due to the mutual coupling of trajectory planning of UAVs, serving the same task requests repeatedly in the same area results in wasted resources. Hence, it is challenging to supply high-quality services while ensuring energy-efficient content caching. To solve this dilemma, a content Caching scheme with Trajectory design through differential evolution and Deep Reinforcement learning (CTDR) is introduced. Specifically, a content caching scheme based on differential evolution (DE) is first proposed. Next, a trajectory design optimization based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) is designed to minimize system energy consumption. Eventually, the superiority of CTDR is demonstrated through various simulated experiments.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in urban search and rescue, where path planning plays a critical role. This paper proposes an approach using off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with an improved exploration mechanism (IEM) based on prioritized experience replay (PER) and curiosity-driven exploration to address the time-constrained path planning problem for UAVs operating in complex unknown environments. Firstly, to meet the task's time constraints, we design a rollout algorithm based on PER to optimize the behavior policy and enhance sampling efficiency. Additionally, we address the issue that certain off-policy RL algorithms often get trapped in local optima in environments with sparse rewards by measuring curiosity using the states' unvisited time and generating intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. Lastly, we introduce IEM into the sampling stage of various off-policy RL algorithms. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, compared to the original off-policy RL algorithms, the algorithms incorporating IEM can reduce the planning time required for rescuing paths and achieve the goal of rescuing all trapped individuals.},

The results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently searches for satisfactory solutions for the collaborative delivery path between trucks and drones across various delivery ranges and quantities of packages in a relatively short timeframe. The cost of truck-and-drone collaborative delivery is reduced by approximately 50.25%, 14.13%, and 7% compared to the initial solution of truck separate delivery, vehicle machine collaborative delivery, and the optimal solution of the traditional simulated annealing algorithm, respectively.

  abstract={In this paper, we propose that allapplication for multi-agent collaborative control, and in particular fixed-wing umanned arial vehicles, can be be described through three basic behaviors. They are Travelling, Wactching, and Tracking. These three behaviors are constructed from two primitive actions, going somewhere and hlding at a particular location. The semantics of the behaviors are clearly difined and justify why these three are chosen. The ability of these behaviors to easily program different missions through hyvrid state flow is illustrated through examples of previously-demonstrated application. Furthermore, this paper outlines three levels of abstraction for a software architecture for collaborative control. In particular, we focus on an procedural-level abstraction that illustrates where the above three behaviors can be used to define applications. This level of abstraction displays software modularity such that different members of a research group can work independently while maintaining a structure that allows successful experimental implementation on the multi-agent platform. Moreover, this modularity allows project members to perform various disparate applications with the platform without considerable software modification. It also promotes software reuse after members leave the group. While focusing primarily on fixed-wing aerial vehicles, the approach presented here is equally applicable to ground and rotorcraft vehicles.},

A novel method for multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance mission planning in denied environment (MUCRMP-DE) based on an improved synthetic heuristic algorithm is proposed to tackle these. In this paper, a hierarchical model is established with the global optimization goal of UAV's minimum radar detection time at first, including the planning of reconnaissance sequence between and within target groups, as well as relative position to targets. Then an improved synthetic heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the model, which obtains valuable reconnaissance mission plan. For an application example of reconnaissance mission involving 68 targets, the simulation results show that the improved synthetic heuristic algorithm can suit the needs of the mission, particularly in effectively evading the detection of multiple radars. While it can also give better anti-radar attributes to the UA V and efficiently improved the convergence speed in the specific reconnaissance mission.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered as one of the promising technologies for the next-generation wireless communication networks. Their mobility and their ability to establish line of sight (LOS) links with the users made them key solutions for many potential applications. In the same vein, artificial intelligence (AI) is growing rapidly nowadays and has been very successful, particularly due to the massive amount of the available data. As a result, a significant part of the research community has started to integrate intelligence at the core of UAVs networks by applying AI algorithms in solving several problems in relation to drones. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of some potential applications of AI in UAV-based networks. We also highlight the limits of the existing works and outline some potential future applications of AI for UAVs networks.},

  title={Cooperative Path Planning of a UAV Swarm to Meet Temporal-Spatial User Demands},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is a promising solution for providing high-quality mobile services (e.g., edge computing, fast Internet connection, and local caching) to ground users, where a UAV with limited service coverage travels among multiple geographical user locations (e.g., hotspots) for servicing demands locally. It is necessary for different UAVs to cooperate with each other for servicing many users, and how to determine their cooperative path planning to best meet many users' spatio-temporally distributed demands is an important question. This paper is the first to design and analyze cooperative path-planning algorithms of a UAV swarm for optimally servicing many spatial locations with dynamic user arrivals and waiting deadlines in the time horizon. For each UAV, it needs to decide whether to wait at the current location or chase a newly released demand in another location, under upper coordination with the other UAVs in the swarm. For each UAV's routing problem even without coordinating with the rest UAVs, it follows dynamic programming structure and is difficult to solve directly given many user demands. We manage to simplify and propose an optimal algorithm of fast computation time (only polynomial with respect to both the numbers of user locations and user demands) for returning the UAV's optimal path-planning. When a large number |K| of UAVs are coordinating, the dynamic programming simplification becomes intractable. Alternatively, we present an iterative cooperation algorithm with approximation ratio 1 - (1 - 1/|K| )|K| in the worst case, which is proved to obviously outperform the traditional idea of partitioning UAVs to serve different user/location clusters separately. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to show that our algorithm's average performance is close to the optimum.},

  year={2007},

  pages={347-352},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a cooperative path planning technique for multiple UAVs that need to cover an unknown region in the presence of obstacles. The UAVs are subjected to limited sensor range, limited communication range and minimum turn radius constraints. A world map of the unknown region is dynamically created based on the information obtained from sensors and others agents. The UAVs use the map to generate feasible and safe paths. The cooperative path planning technique selects a path from the feasible set of safe paths in coordination with other UAVs using a dynamic leader approach. The path planning technique takes UAV deconfliction into account. Simulation results are presented to verify that the UAVs cover the entire region while satisfying the constraints.},

  abstract={In this paper we present a cooperative system for field surveillance. The system consists of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned all-terrain vehicle (U-ATV). UAV and U-ATV are equipped with a variety of sensors and mission processors so they can collect external environmental information and respond to dynamic environment independently. In addition, UAV and U-ATV are remotely monitored and operated by the ground station system. The proposed unmanned cooperative system can applied to field patrol and surveillance missions, including such as fire detection, environmental protection, enemy reconnaissance, target tracking and so on.

  abstract={This paper deals with 3D cooperative path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in a static environment with known stationary obstacles. Differential geometry techniques based on Pythagorean Hodographs (PH) are adapted to plan cooperatively the paths of UAVs and avoid collisions. UAV paths are first generated using PH curves assuming obstacles free environment. Then, these paths are made flyable by imposing vehicle dynamic constraints. The flyable paths are then amended according to the known obstacle map to avoid collisions. These obstacles-collision free paths are further checked for inter collision. Cooperation in terms of simultaneous vehicle arrival is considered on the obtained feasible (flyable and safe) UAV paths. Simulation results based on swarm of UAVs scenario show the efficiency of the proposed technique.},

  abstract={Based on extended set-membership filter (ESMF) and the path planning method in relative velocity coordinates (RVCs), a new 3D multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems active cooperative observation method, high precision cooperative observing a moving target by proper planning the behavior of each member vehicle, is proposed. The new method combines the ESMF based cooperative observation method and the LP-based trajectory generation method in RVCs, where the ESMF based cooperative method is used to obtain the moving target's motion state which is further used as part of the cost function to plan the UAV's behavior by using the planning method in RVCs. The contribution of this paper is: (1) the computational burden of the proposed cooperative algorithm is comparable to single ESMF algorithm; (2) the high precision observation of moving target is always obtainable by considering the optimal observation condition during trajectory planning; (3) the planning algorithm in RVCs, where the trajectory planning can be modeled as a LP problem, is used to optimize the UAV's behavior, thus, in company with (Gu, et al; 2006), the fast application of the new proposed active cooperative observation method is desirable. Finally, the simulations in 3D environments are conducted to verify the feasibility and validity of the method.},

  abstract={The Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) cooperative detection systems are widely used in terrain reconnaissance, disaster rescue and urban/rural buildings survey, in which the UAV in the air can provide a broad view and take photography, while the UGV on the ground can offer sufficient load capacity and serve as repeater stations as well. The path planning of UAV/UGV is one of the most important issues in the cooperative detection system, and its studies have attracted great attentions in recent years. In this study, a two-level memetic path planning algorithm is proposed to help the unmanned air/ground vehicle cooperative systems detect realistic urban illegal building, considering the limits of the endurance capacity of the UAV, the load capacity of the UGV, and the communication restrictions between them. Experiments on both the synthetic data and the realistic urban illegal building data show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on solving the path planning problem in the UAV/UGV cooperative system for urban illegal building detection tasks.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have found widespread applications in executing high-complexity and remote-risk missions. However, the limited onboard resources and energy of UAV swarms may hinder their support for computation-intensive yet delay-sensitive applications, especially when faced with exponentially growing big data. This article focuses on investigating a UAV swarm-assisted aerial–ground collaborative computing system, where one UAV swarm is divided into different groups and collaborates with a remote ground base station (BS) to provide computation services for ground smart mobile devices (SMDs). A comprehensive optimization framework is presented to maximize the system’s computation efficiency by jointly designing group formation, UAV trajectories, and resource allocation. The formulated problem involves a fractional structure with nonlinear coupling of different variables, rendering it highly nonconvex. To address this challenge, we propose a Dinkelbach-based looped iterative optimization (DLIO) algorithm. Specifically, Dinkelbach’s method is initially adopted to reformulate the original problem into a parametric structure, which is then decomposed into subproblems for group formation, resource allocation, and UAVs’ trajectory scheduling. Subsequently, these subproblems are addressed by a looped iterative optimization (LIO) algorithm. The outer loop determines group forming and resource allocation, while the inner loop utilizes the method of successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve trajectory scheduling for UAVs. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed DLIO algorithm, ensuring rapid convergence and significant improvements in the system’s computation efficiency compared to other benchmarks.},

  abstract={Flying Ad-Hoc Network (FANET) is a special type of Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) which consists of multiple networked Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Compared to traditional target search using a single UAV, multiple cooperative UAVs within a FANET have the potential to accomplish this work more efficiently, and multi-UAV cooperative target search has attracted increasing research attention in recent years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation on efficient and accurate multi-UAV cooperative target search techniques. More specifically, we propose several adaptive mobility models and an innovative information fusion mechanism to improve the search efficiency. Meanwhile, to improve the search accuracy, we introduce a low-overhead decision-making mechanism to reduce chances for false target identifications. The simulation results show that the framework outperforms the baseline framework significantly in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments also exhibit how individual mechanisms introduced in our work contribute to the improvements on search efficiency or accuracy, therefore providing more guidance for their adoption in practice.},
