  abstract={In this paper, we tackle the control and trajectory planning problems for the cooperative transportation system of cable-suspended payload with multi Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Firstly, a payload controller is presented considering the dynamic coupling between the UAV and the payload to accomplish the active suppression of payload swing and the complex payload trajectory tracking. Secondly, different from the simplification of obstacles in most approaches, we propose three Insetting Formation (IF) algorithms for the complete obstacle shape to generate collision-free waypoints for the cooperative transportation system. An IF strategy is proposed by integrating three IF algorithms to improve the success rate of obstacle avoidance and reduce the algorithm complexity for performing the aggressive flight. Finally, we verify the robustness and high performance of the proposed algorithm through benchmark comparison and real-world experiments. Moreover, our source code is released as an open-source ros package.},

  abstract={This paper develops notional technical design requirements for a team of autonomous air and ground vehicles for civil infrastructure inspection. Such a heterogeneous robot team can produce augmented maps of regions of interest with wider coverage and reduced uncertainty compared to mapping done by either platform alone because of the ability to exploit drastically different vantage points. In cases where visual scanning provides insufficient data, the aerial vehicle can deliver a ground vehicle equipped with additional sensors for nondestructive testing. State-of-the-art implementations support the validity of such a system, and preliminary testing suggests future work.},

  abstract={Cooperative navigation is a promising strategy to enable safe autonomous flight in GNSS challenging environments. This paper discusses a cooperative strategy that guarantees bounded navigation error for an UAV flying in poor GNSS coverage conditions (“son”), exploiting the support of a cooperative vehicle (“father”) and the available GNSS observables. A customized path planning strategy is developed for the father UAV, which is aimed at minimizing son positioning uncertainty. In view of real time implementation, path planning is complemented by proper cooperative guidance strategies. Planning and guidance approaches are verified in simulations that take into account three-dimensional environment and multi-GNSS constellation coverage. Cooperative navigation potential is demonstrated in experiments carried out flying two quadrotors in formation. In these flight tests, GNSS-challenging conditions are simulated off-line by assuming a virtual three-dimensional environment and removing GNSS satellites that would not be in view.},

  abstract={The use of autonomous mobile robots in different applications has increased significantly over the past years, which can be executed individually or collaboratively, considering the use of Multi-Robot Systems (MRS), that presents several advantages but also raises many challenges. Specifically, when considering heterogeneous robots, it is paramount to develop techniques that respect individual restrictions and benefit the use of their different capabilities. In this paper, we consider a ground/aerial collaboration for inventory inspection in warehouse environments. The goal is to determine a set of optimized combined paths that maximize the number of shelves inspected. The problem is formulated as a dual Orienteering Problem (OP), where the budget of both vehicles is considered, and the rewards, which are related to the shelves that can be visited, are estimated by a greedy strategy. Results in simulated scenarios considering different aspects provide a thorough evaluation and validation of the methodology.},

  abstract={Cooperative and intelligent path planning is important for UAVs to carry out coordinated Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) in adversarial environments. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic data fusion aided platform routing algorithm for cooperative ISR. Our approach consists of three closely coupled components: 1) Closed-loop data fusion. The Level 1 (Object), Level 2 (Situation) and Level 3 (threat) data fusion form a closed-loop structure, in which Markov game theoretic intent inferences will execute from the results of Level 1 and Level 2 results. The estimated threat intents will be fed back to the Level 2 fusion to improve the performance of the entity aggregation. 2) Cooperative platform routing based on Pareto-optimization, social foraging, and cooperative jamming. Given the threat information including the threat intents from the data fusion module, a Pareto-optimal problem is formed and Graph-cut based fast solution serves as a reference trajectory for a foraging algorithm, which further dynamically refines the reference path to avoid pop-up obstacles detected along the planned path. 3) Display/Monitor Module, in which relevant threats and constraints information are indicated, the terrain data are shown, and current real route and planned route are highlighted, compared, and evaluated. The commander's suggestions can be inputted in this mode.},

  abstract={UAVs carrying visual sensors to capture the defects on the building surface has the advantages of high efficiency, low cost, flexibility and convenience. This kind of inspection task is called coverage path planning problem in 3D space. When the target to be detected is a large complex building, multi-UAV collaboration is usually required. So, how to obtain the optimal path of multi-UAV becomes a great challenge. In order to solve the problem, Asynchronous Ant Colony Optimization (AACO), which makes multiple ant colonies move forward asynchronously, is proposed here to conquer the difficulty. Firstly, the random sampling method is used to get the potential UAV waypoints in the 3D free environment, based on which a Primitive Coverage Graph (PCG) is constructed. Also, the visibility matrix and coverage rate are defined to quantify the coverage performance of UAV path primitives. Next, Asynchronous Ant Colony Optimization combined with reward strategy is proposed to solve the problem by selecting jump cities in turn. Finally, several simulations are provided to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm.},

Drone teams are one of the most prominent applications of cooperative unmanned systems and represent an ideal solution for providing both autonomous detection and recognition within security surveillance and monitoring. Here, a drone team may be arranged as a mobile and cooperative sensor network, whose coordination mechanism shall ensure real-time reconfiguration and sensing task balancing within the team. This work proposes a dynamic and decentralized mission planner of a drone team to attain a cooperative behaviour concerning detection and recognition for security surveillance.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become very popular in many military and civilian applications where they are required to fly autonomously through unknown environments to perform some tasks without human interaction. Safe strategies are needed to control the motion of UAVs, and navigation decisions should be based mainly on onboard sensors observations for a fully autonomous operation. Developing such strategies is very challenging when considering dynamic environments with moving obstacles and other non-cooperative UAVs as usual path planning methods can be computationally unreliable. Hence, this work proposes a safe navigation control strategy based on the sense-and-avoid paradigm to allow for a reliable solution computational-wise. Bezier splines are used to generate motion paths which are manipulated in realtime reacting to current sensors observations resulting in a deformation-like effect to navigate safely around obstacles. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using the Gazebo simulator within a ROS framework, and good results were obtained for different simulation scenarios.},

  abstract={Since Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm emerged with the merit of high efficiency, flexibility and robustness in search tasks, related research has been in the spotlight in recent years. In this paper, an adaptive cooperative search method with the ability of collision avoidance for multi-UAVs is presented on the basis of the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and the efficient topological planning method EGO-Swarm. Remarkably, apart from the introduction of adaptive strategy to compensate for the easy tendency to local optimum of classic PSO, a mechanism of autonomous path planning is innovatively incorporated into PSO algorithm to eliminate possible collisions. This, while inheriting the intrinsic advantages of PSO like few parameters, simple implications and low computational complexity, facilitates the practical application of UAVs in nonideal search environments. Simulation shows that our method proposed is well suited for rapid target localization in scenes dense with obstacles, while confliction among UAVs can also be avoided swiftly.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={39392-39410},
  abstract={Task assignment is a critical technology for heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Target precedence has typically been ignored in previous studies, such that it is possible to obtain a task assignment solution with an unreasonable target execution order. For this reason, a cooperative multiple task assignment problem with target precedence constraints (CMTAPTPC) model is proposed in this paper, which considers not only kinematic, resource, and task precedence constraints of the UAV, but also target precedence to achieve more realistic scenarios. In addition, a graph method is improved to detect and eliminate deadlocks in solutions that include target precedence constraints. We also introduced a waitable path coordination (WPC) algorithm to generate conflict-free flight paths. Unlike the traditional path elongation method, this method can reduce the number of path elongation operations and save the energy of UAVs. Based on the characteristics of the CMTAPTPC model, this study proposes a modified genetic algorithm that integrates the graph-based method and WPC algorithm to solve the task assignment problem. In the simulation, three problem-scale scenarios were designed, and the superior performance of the modified genetic algorithm was demonstrated by comparing it with a traditional genetic algorithm. Finally, a time series diagram shows the task assignment solution that meets all time constraints and illustrates the rationality of the WPC algorithm.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the problems of autonomous task assignment and path planning for a fleet of heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles in cooperative mission. In previous work many algorithms almost run on centralized architecture and handle the task assignment decoupling with the path planning. This may result in poor solutions. Therefore, this paper investigates a novel integrated solution for UAV to perform multiple consecutive tasks cooperatively on multiple ground targets based on distributed planning architecture. In a given scenario, the heterogeneous vehicles have different capabilities, kinematic constraints, and fuel constraints. Furthermore, the task has other constraints, such as task execution orders, UAV conflict free constraints, etc. This paper presents details of the non-decoupling solution which produces optimal assignment and trajectories for several given scenarios. The performance of the algorithm is compared to that of some previous methods in real-time simulation environment. The simulations results show the viability of the non-decoupling approach, and the non-decoupling solution has an advantage over hierarchical algorithms, and the distributed architecture improves the operation efficiency of the algorithm and the robustness of the UAV.},

  abstract={This paper presents a cooperative control structure appropriate for cooperative tasks requiring a high degree of tightly coupled coordinated action by multiple dynamic vehicles. The method is based on the formation of a cooperative control Lyapunov function (CCLF). The CCLF is a positive definite function involving the states of the cooperating vehicles and provides a metric of the team's performance useful for higher level assignment algorithms. Low level control laws are obtained by separating the CCLF into multiple agent control functions (ACFs). Forcing the time derivative of the ACFs to be negative definite gives rise to individual control laws for each agent and assures decrement of the CCLF and therefore convergence of the team. The cooperative ground moving target engagement (CGMTE) scenario is utilized as a case study. Simulation results are shown},

  abstract={This paper considers the path planning problem for deployment and collection of a marsupial vehicle system which consists of an unmanned ground vehicle(UGV) and two flying robots. The UGV, as a carrier, is able to deploy and retrieve the flying robots while each of the latter usually takes off and lands on the carrier. This work is motivated by cooperative search and reconnaissance missions in field of heterogeneous robot system. A sequence of tasks, whose positions are known as prior knowledge, are expected to be accessed by the flying robots in a given order. Owing to their limited duration in the air, the aerial robots, usually unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), should return to the UGV timely and land for its energy-saving and recharge. This paper mainly contributes on the mathematical model for path planning of the special marsupial system. Many real constraints including the maximum velocity of the UAV and the UGV, the maximum hovering time and so on are taken into account in the model. The objective function is constructed by minimizing the time for completing the whole mission. In order to clarify the novel method, a single task point model first is proposed and then extended to multi tasks one. Finally, particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is used to solve the path planning problem. Several simulations verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={A cooperative navigation architecture for the search and recognition of targets using aerial and ground vehicles is proposed in this paper. Two main tasks are conceived; an aerial monitoring of a surface for searching targets, and a target ground recognition. First, the aerial drone tracks autonomously a trajectory, computed to cover all the surface to monitor, to search for targets using vision algorithms. Once detected, its relative position is sent to the cooperative architecture. After the aerial drone has covered the entire area, the architecture computes and assigns to each ground vehicle the closest target found. Then, each ground vehicle navigates autonomously avoiding obstacles to its assigned target. To verify the success of the mission, the aerial vehicle flies over the dynamic center of mass of the ground vehicles. Real-time experiments are carried out to validate the proposed architecture. Main results, depicted in some graphs, corroborate the good performance in closed loop.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a cost-effective strategy for heterogeneous UAV swarm systems for cooperative aerial inspection.

In this work, agents are partitioned into teams, with each drone assign a different task, including mapping, exploration, and inspection. Task allocation is facilitated by assigning optimal inspection volumes to each team, following best-first rules. A voxel map-based representation of the environment is used for pathfinding, and a rule-based path-planning method is the core of this approach. We achieved the best performance in all challenging experiments with the proposed approach, surpassing all benchmark methods for similar tasks across multiple evaluation trials.

  abstract={A novel passing priority allocation method, based on the collision avoidance urgency, used for a formation of UAVs in a serried obstacle laden environment, is presented in this article. The method employs the collision cone and the prediction of the collision time to evaluate the urgency of imminent collision of each UAV, so as to establish a primary criterion for the priority allocation. And, the priority update policy is also innovative designed to alleviate burdens on the instability of frequent shifty context. This article exploits the potential field in a cooperative way to plan the path for each UAV, steering the UAVs to a given 3-D position, which combines the adaptive priorities to guide the UAVs passing through the barriers in turn. Numerical simulations and semi-physical experiments in designed outdoor condition are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed adaptive priorities with the regular-used default priorities. The total passing time and the energy cost of the semi-physical tests provide the promising validation in terms of the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Modern UAVs are expected to be able to fly safely through the area where GNSS signal is weak or even could not be received. In order to realize it, the intuitive idea is by adding some airborne sensors and processor chips, which is, however, not practically feasible for the UAVs that have limited payload capability and online-computing resources. To address this issue, this paper presents a technical solution for building autonomous navigation system based on the concept of Ground-Aerial Vehicle Cooperation. The key features of the solution lie in four aspects: 1) A local reliable self-organizing network is constructed for transmitting control commands and estimated pose information between the UAV and a reusable ground robot; 2) A small and lightweight monocular camera is equipped on the UAV to achieve visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) considering the limitation of UAV's carrying capacity; 3) The modified ORB-SLAM2 system equipped on the ground robot rebuilds a global dense map and reconstructs the 3D environment based on the Octomap; and 4) The low-cost, commercial ground robots and rotor craft were chosen to facilitate other researchers to build a similar platform quickly. Four in-door flight experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the technical solution. Other potential and extendable applications of the cooperation system include: real-time reconstruction of environmental maps, collaborative obstacle avoidance and path planning, and motion synchronization control.},

  abstract={The limited time duration and spatial instability of TSTs increase the difficulty of mission planning for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formations, which in turn affects the task execution abilities of UAVs.

The proposed algorithm comprehensively considers a variety of complex constraints involved in actual application scenarios and constructs a UAV formation mission planning model with minimum task execution cost and path planning cost as the optimization goal. In this article, particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved by introducing a specific particle coding method and a competitive co-evolutionary population updating strategy, to enhance the solution speed and accuracy of the mission planning model. In this way, the optimal task allocation strategy and task execution path are obtained to meet the mission requirements, and to achieve the multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance, strike and evaluation of multiple TSTs. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via simulations.},

  title={Travelling salesman problem for UAV path planning with two parallel optimization algorithms}, 
  year={2017},
  volume={},

  pages={832-837},
  abstract={To solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP) for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning, we propose two parallel optimization algorithms. One is the improved genetic algorithm (IGA), and the other is the particle-swarm-optimization-based ant colony optimization algorithm (PSO-ACO). As an indispensable part of UAV cooperative mission assignment, the research of UAV path planning has attracted much attention of scholars. In this paper, according to the characteristics of UAV path planning, we firstly establish a corresponding multi-objective multi-constrained combinatorial optimization model-TSP. In the TSP model, the UAV is considered as the travelling salesman, and the mission target is regarded as the travelling city. Then, considering that TSP is a complex NP-hard problem, this paper carries out two optimization algorithms as IGA and PSO-ACO to solve the TSP model, which both can obtain effective and reasonable UAV path planning schemes. IGA is a kind of evolutionary algorithm with implicit parallel ability and global optimization ability. Through the rational selection of encoding mode and fitness function, and valid setting of selection operator, crossover operator and mutation operator, IGA can solve the TSP with great convergence. PSO-ACO is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm with inherently parallel ability and self-organizing ability, which is perfect for solving TSP. Adopting the idea of particle optimization into ant colony optimization algorithm, ants in PSO-ACO system have the particle characteristics that can adjust the local optimal solution and global optimal solution after completing every single traversal. Finally, in the simulation part, based on the stochastic dynamic map, this paper builds the TSP model for UAV path planning. Through the comprehensive analyses of the optimization results of two proposed parallel optimization algorithms and one contrast approach, we can conclude that the proposed IGA and PSO-ACO algorithms are more rational and effective for solving UAV path planning problem compared with the contrast approach.},

  abstract={This paper presents a sophisticated vision-aided flocking system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is able to operate in GPS-denied unknown environments for exploring and searching missions, and also able to adopt two types of vision sensors, day and thermal cameras, to measure relative motion between UAVs in different lighting conditions without using wireless communication. In order to realize robust vision-aided flocking, an integrated framework of tracking-learning-detection on the basis of multifeature coded correlation filter has been developed. To achieve long-term tracking, a redetector is trained online to adaptively reinitialize target for global sensing. An advanced flocking strategy is developed to address the autonomous multi-UAVs' cooperative flight. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based navigation modules are developed for autonomous localization, mapping, and obstacle avoidance. Flight experiments of a team of UAVs have been conducted to verify the performance of this flocking system in a GPS-denied environment. The extensive experiments validate the robustness of the proposed vision algorithms in challenging scenarios.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={118168-118180},
  abstract={As the atmospheric pollution becomes an increasingly serious problem, finding accurately the location of pollutant sources is still challenging. In the present work, a probability-based tracking strategy is proposed for guiding two cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a quest area to find an atmospheric pollutant source. This tracking strategy implies deploying algorithmically two phases: exploration and exploitation. During the exploration phase each vehicle follows a trajectory based on plane coordinates generated from a Hammersley sequence. The overlapping between UAVs’ trajectories is avoided by splitting guidance points into two groups by using the k-means algorithm. The navigation trajectories are smoothed by an TSP solver and a cubic spline planning algorithm. The exploitation phase redirects the search to specific locations where the probability of finding the source is higher. This is achieved by considering the quest area as a mesh, where each cell is assigned a probability computed with information collected by the UAVs measurement system. Every time a high concentration is found, the probabilities are recalculated, and flight trajectories are adjusted. The trajectories are semicircular, and the radius is decreased when a new high concentration is found. Simulation data of the proposed tracking strategy shows promising results on the accuracy achieved in the finding of the pollutant source, in comparison with three other tracking strategies: leader-follower, random walk with particle swarm optimization, and a hill climb traceability algorithm.},

  abstract={We present an integrated and intelligent cooperative platform for the detection, recognition and tracking of objects in the air, underwater and on the surface. The system is based on a data integration process driven by the coordinated use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) equipped with heterogeneous sensors (e.g., magnetometers, electro-optical sensors, cameras and microphones) sending the acquired data to a centralized Ground Control Station (GCS). When the area to be monitored is large, it is needed to partition it, assigning each part to different UAVs/UUVs. Thus, those UAVs and UUVs are the nodes of a communication network where data exchange is aimed at the communication of information relating to the detection/recognition/tracking of objects. This kind of messages is very important when, for example, the object being tracked moves out of the area of competence of a given UAV/UUV to enter another area surveyed by a different UAV/UUV. The system will be useful for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance) applications including both the identification of static objects positioned on the seabed (e.g., unexploded bombs, underwater infrastructures, etc.) and the identification and tracking of objects moving underwater, on the surface or flying in the area of interest. A study on a secure and encrypted wireless connection between the fleet of drones and the GCS is also addressed and an effective method for changing data encryption keys during the mission is illustrated.},

  abstract={The health condition of a building is related to the safety of people's lives and properties, so it is especially important to accurately detect its surface structure damage. Initial assessment of a building's health condition often involves identifying these cracks on its surface images. However, capturing these images traditionally relies on human labor, and the small pixel size of cracks in two-dimensional images makes segmentation challenging. In this study, a pioneering approach is introduced for automatic detection of building surface structure damage based on multi-UAV collaboration. The method comprises two primary components. Firstly, we introduce a reconstruction mathematical model based on MVS reconstruction rules to estimate the reconstruction quality. This model guides the extension of multi-UAV trajectories, considering trajectory energy consumption and security, enabling automated image capture and the creation of high-quality 3D models. Secondly, we design a spatial attention mechanism that incorporates Canny edge detection information and improve the deeplabV3 model to realize the automatic recognition of small cracks on building surfaces. Real-world experiments demonstrate that our method facilitates collaborative multi-UAV image capture, supporting high-quality 3D reconstruction and achieving precise crack segmentation.},

  abstract={Perception is necessary for autonomous navigation in an unknown area crowded with obstacles. It’s challenging for a robot to navigate safely without any sensors that can sense the environment, resulting in a blind robot, and becomes more difficult when comes to a group of robots. However, it could be costly to equip all robots with expensive perception or SLAM systems. In this paper, we propose a novel system named ColAG, to solve the problem of autonomous navigation for a group of blind UGVs by introducing cooperation with one UAV, which is the only robot that has full perception capabilities in the group. The UAV uses SLAM for its odometry and mapping while sharing this information with UGVs via limited relative pose estimation. The UGVs plan their trajectories in the received map and predict possible failures caused by the uncertainty of its wheel odometry and unknown risky areas. The UAV dynamically schedules waypoints to prevent UGVs from collisions, formulated as a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows to optimize the UAV’s trajectories and minimize time when UGVs have to wait to guarantee safety. We validate our system through extensive simulation with up to 7 UGVs and real-world experiments with 3 UGVs.},

  abstract={Due to their flexibility and agility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising approach to cluster planning within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the limited battery capacity of a single UAV limits its application in many situations, such as searching in wild areas. In this article, we propose a computational scheme of cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAVs based on Voronoi diagrams and intelligent swarm optimization algorithm. In this article: 1) Voronoi diagrams are used to model the field environment according to the radar sensor position; 2) an improved  $K$ -medoids algorithm based on the maximum empty circle property of the Voronoi diagram (Vor- $K$ -medoids) is proposed to complete the reconnaissance UAVs (RUAVs) domain cooperative search; and 3) a hyperbolic tangent heuristic function intelligent optimization algorithm is proposed to calculate the minimum risk path for the attack UAV (AUAV) according to the characteristics of the attack mission. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme integrates the properties of the Voronoi diagram, clustering algorithm, and path planning algorithm commendably. Compared with the traditional ant colony optimization (ACO), under the same number of iterations, the probability of obtaining the optimal track is improved by 14%, and the running time is shortened by 50.87%.The proposed scheme offers a practical and cost-effective approach for efficiently searching areas within large-scale radar sensors in real-world scenarios.},

To exploit their complementary features (e.g., fields of views, communication links, computing capabilities), a promising paradigm termed integrated robotics network therefore emerges, which provides communications for cooperative UAVs-UGVs applications. However, how to efficiently deploy UAVs and schedule the UAVs-UGVs connections according to different UGV tasks become challenging. In this paper, we consider the sum-rate maximization problem, where UGVs plan their trajectories autonomously and are dynamically associated with UAVs according to their planned trajectories. Although this problem is a NP-hard mixed integer program, a fast polynomial time algorithm using alternating gradient descent and penalty-based binary relaxation, is devised. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract={The effect of an obstacle on signal strength attenuation is the most important reason that affects the performance of distance estimation based on Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) observations. Consequently, in this paper, a novel approach for estimation of the location and height of an obstacle between two UAVs using RSSI observations is proposed which would help to better estimate the location of a radio frequency (RF) source. The long-term goal of developing this approach is to improve the localization of an RF source by removing the effect of obstacle(s) on the signal attenuation. This approach is based on path planning of the UAVs to estimate the tip of the obstacle between them. The change in the diffraction loss observations are used to find the Line Of Sight (LOS) positions of the UAVs. These LOS lines, constructed by connecting the UAVs in LOS situation, are the locus of the tip of the obstacle and used in an iterative geometrical approach for estimation of the location of the tip of the obstacle. Due to the uncertainty in determining the LOS position which is created because of the radius of the Fresnel zone, the motion steps of UAVs, and the non-modeled dynamics in signal attenuation, an EKF filter is used to estimate the tip of the obstacle. The approach has been simulated and the results show that the approach provides better accuracy in RF source localization compared to the basic approach which does not consider the obstacles in the localization process.},

Cooperation consists in enhancing navigation performance of the platform in the challenging area by using another UAV that flies under nominal GNSS coverage and is always in visual line of sight (LOS) with the first. Satellite coverage is estimated with a multi-GNSS constellation approach and challenging areas are defined by setting a threshold for the Dilution of Precision.

We firstly formulate the average age of information (AoI) minimization problem of the UAV-assisted MEC systems. To maintain the system timeliness, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach, called edge federated multi-agent actor-critic (MAAC), for joint trajectory planning, data scheduling and resource management in the investigated MEC systems. Through the proposed online learning method, edge devices and center controller learn the interactive policies through local observations and carry out the model-wise communication. We build up a simulation platform for time sensitive MEC systems as a gym environment module and implement the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the comparisons with a popular MARL solution, MADDPG, show that the proposed approach achieves better performance in terms of data freshness and system stability.},

  abstract={Recently, some spraying systems have been proposed that use a drone towing a liquid tube. However, towable tube length is limited due to the payload of a drone, and there is a possibility of liquid leakage from the tube or that the drone will fall. To solve these problems, this research proposes a liquid feeding system where the tube and cables are towed cooperatively by multiple drones. By using multiple drones, the length of the towable tube can be longer, and the working space can be enlarged. In addition, if the power cable is also towed together with the tube the amount of time the drone can be used will increase because a battery will not be necessary. In particular, this paper describes the movable range of the drones while considering tube tension.},

  abstract={Multi-agent systems (MAS) are composed of multiple autonomous agents that interact and collaborate to achieve common objectives. These systems are characterized by their decentralization, scalability, robustness, and the local perspectives of individual agents. In the realm of quadrotor applications, MAS can perform complex tasks such as formation flying, surveillance, search and rescue, and cooperative payload transport. The control of such systems often involves techniques like trajectory planning, consensus algorithms, formation control, and obstacle avoidance. This study introduces a multi-agent quadrotor system controlled using sliding mode backstepping control (SMBC), which combines the advantages of backstepping and sliding mode control to ensure stability and robustness. The novel aspect of this research is the transformation of the leader quadrotor into a fractional-order system (FOS) while maintaining the followers as integer-order systems, all controlled using the same SMBC method. MATLAB simulations validate that the fractional-order leader (FOL) achieves superior trajectory tracking compared to the integer-order leader. Furthermore, the followers tracking the fractional-order leader exhibit enhanced performance, with reduced tracking errors and quicker response times. These findings demonstrate the potential advantages of incorporating fractional-order dynamics into multi-agent control systems.},

The objective is to control UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) circled to the target under the preset track and in a certain time interval. For the circumstance of the known location of start point and target point of UAV, we put forward a control method of angular velocity, with fixed velocity and trajectory of UAV. And in this control method, based on the nature of the Archimedes spiral, the time of UAV from the start point to the target point can be accurately calculated.},

  abstract={To complete the monitoring and searching task of large amphibious areas, multiple Unmanned Amphibious Vehicles (UAVs) have been introduced to solve the coverage problem of such areas. However, few studies were conducted on the coverage problem in amphibious environments, which is particularly challenging and urgent. In this case, we propose a collaborative coverage strategy to achieve amphibious regional coverage. Our approach is based on the following parts. Firstly, a centralized area allocation strategy is used to allocate subregion coverage tasks to each agent. Secondly, a distributed path planning algorithm is used to plan the coverage of each UAV in the amphibious environment to minimize the energy loss of the UAVs. This strategy incorporates the importance of the region and the ability of the agent, which shows great adaptability to the amphibious environment. Finally, the proposed strategy is compared with several previous popular methods in the simulations to verify its effective performance.},

Attention is particularly paid to UAS, which is capable of navigating through in cluttered indoor and outdoor GPS-denied environments, such as hostile buildings, sewer tunnels, radiation contaminated areas and inside forests. Topics under studied include dynamic modelling of an unmanned helicopter, advanced flight control system design, multi-sensory data fusion, real-time simultaneous localization and mapping, and dynamic path planning in unknown environments. We will particularly showcase the development of an unconventional hybrid aircraft, which has the capability of taking off and landing vertically, and transiting to a fixed-wing mode for fast cruise flight. We will also take this opportunity to highlight some techniques that we have recently developed for the 2017 International Micro Air Vehicles (IMAV) Competition, which was held in Toulouse, France, September 18–21, 2017. The IMAV Competition is a yearly event that aims at fostering key technologies for the development of micro-air vehicles. It provides an arena for research groups around the world to showcase their research achievements and to test their results in real environments. Besides the unmanned aerial systems capable of navigating fully autonomously in GPS-denied environments, we have also managed to achieve sophisticated cooperative control and task management of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles for heavy duty missions.},

  abstract={Object search is a complex and demanding task, especially in an unknown or partially known environment; therefore, having an adequate strategy to enhance this task is essential. With recent advances in robotics systems, a single robot could perform complex autonomous object finding tasks, nevertheless, using a team of heterogeneous robots this task can be sped up by combining the individual capabilities of the robots. In this work, a strategy to search an object and reach its location is presented. The proposed strategy is based on the exploration of an unknown environment through the collaboration of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) and a ground vehicle. To evaluate the proposed strategy, a virtual structured environment was built in which there is a UAV, equipped with a monocular camera pointing downwards, and a differential drive robot equipped with a depth sensor.},

  abstract={The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for air-to-ground mission in complex environments has increased considerably in recent years. The numerous studies on UAVs cooperative air-to-ground mission controlling have been reported, but few have considered the impact of the communication instability due to electromagnetic interference (EMI) which is common in many air-to-ground applications. Under the influence of EMI, the air-to-ground mission stages are represented as a dynamic combination of several communication-available and communication-unavailable stages. Traditional cooperative surveillance algorithms cannot handle such situations well. In this study, we presented a method which based on Voronoi diagrams to solve the impact of communication outages, and an attention mechanism ant-colony optimization (AACO) algorithm was proposed for UAV path-planning control in air-to-ground surveillance missions. The controlling strategy is adaptively updated by introducing an attention mechanism for regular instruction information, a priori information, and emergent information of the mission to satisfy the mission target. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better search performance than traditional algorithms in scenarios which include communication-available and communication-unavailable situations.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={This paper reports on a method to obtain a multidomain (environment) awareness on a floating target (non-responsive ship, iceberg, other floating structure) using a heterogeneous collaborative team of above, surface and underwater robots. This allows, for example, a ship approaching a non-responsive floating target to get information from a safe standoff prior to getting closer to further investigate or to attempt a boarding. The above-water unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), integrated with optical cameras, obtains measurements of the above-water geometry using visual imagery to create an above-water three-dimensional model using photogrammetry methods. The below-water unmanned underwater vehicle is integrated with an imaging and profiling bathymetric sonars to capture the submerged hull geometry and features. An unmanned surface vehicle (USV) hosts an intelligent node which centrally controls the robotic collaboration by autonomously planning and distributing the mission for both the UUV and UAV. The results from the two are fused to yield a more complete picture of the floating target. We present results from simulations and a controlled in-water trial with an UUV, USV and UAV. The contributions from this work includes the robotic collaboration and autonomy across multiple domains, autonomous mission-planning and the fusing of multi-domain data. The scheduling of inter-dependent multi-robot task allocation is addressed in the autonomous mission-planning. The approach is validated in simulations and tested in-water. The in-water trials highlight the challenges and value of integrating sensors on distributed multi-domain robots towards a more complete picture on a floating target.},

Sensors are initially clustered based on proximity and then iteratively combined into larger-size clusters. Tasks are assigned to UGVs and UAVs, with UGVs covering some of the clusters and UAVs handling the rest. The GA determines the optimal paths within each cluster. This approach ensures that the overall resource usage is optimized, outperforming existing methods by achieving higher energy efficiency with lower time complexity.},

  abstract={Recent developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) have made them highly useful for various tasks. However, they both have their respective constraints that make them incapable of completing intricate tasks alone in many scenarios. For example, a UGV is unable to reach high places, while a UAV is limited by its power supply and payload capacity. In this paper, we propose an Imitation Augmented Deep Reinforcement Learning (IADRL) model that enables a UGV and UAV to form a coalition that is complementary and cooperative for completing tasks that they are incapable of achieving alone. IADRL learns the underlying complementary behaviors of UGVs and UAVs from a demonstration dataset that is collected from some simple scenarios with non-optimized strategies. Based on observations from the UGV and UAV, IADRL provides an optimized policy for the UGV-UAV coalition to work in an complementary way while minimizing the cost. We evaluate the IADRL approach in an visual game-based simulation platform, and conduct experiments that show how it effectively enables the coalition to cooperatively and cost-effectively accomplish tasks.},

  abstract={Autonomous collaborative robotics is a topic of significant interest to groups such as the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). These two groups have been developing systems for the operation of autonomous vehicles over the past several years, but each system has several critical drawbacks. AFRL's Unmanned Systems Autonomy Services (UxAS) supports pathfinding for multiple tasks performed by groups of vehicles, but has no formal verification, very little physical flight time, and no concept of collision avoidance. NASA's Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems (ICAROUS) has collision avoidance, partial formal verification, and thousands of hours of physical flight time, but has no concept of collaboration. AFRL and NASA each wanted to incorporate the features of the other's software into their own, and so the CRoss-Application Translator for Operational Unmanned Systems (CRATOUS) was created. CRATOUS creates a communication bridge between UxAS and ICAROUS, allowing for full feature integration of the two systems. This combined software is the first system that allows for the safe and reliable cooperation of groups of unmanned vehicles.},

This framework leads to the development of a modeling language for UAV trajectories, based on the interconnection of a finite number of suitably defined motion primitives, or maneuvers. Building on similar considerations, a concept of motion coordination primitive is introduced, and used to define a motion description language for cooperative multiple-vehicle systems. Once the language is defined, algorithms for the efficient computation of feasible and optimal motion coordination plans can be implemented. The application of the proposed technique to motion planning for a group of small model helicopters is discussed, through examples on a high-fidelity simulation.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel fast collision avoidance algorithm for navigation in 3D space of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). This algorithm is aimed at increasing the ability of aircraft operations to complete mission goals by enabling fast collision avoidance of multiple obstacles. The new algorithm, named Flexible Geometric Algorithm (FGA), combines geometric avoidance of obstacles and selection of a critical avoidance start time based on kinematic considerations. FGA reduced computational time by 90% when compared to current waypoint generation methods for collision avoidance. The starting point for the avoidance time window is determined by collision likelihood. Using this algorithm, the (Unmanned Air Vehicle) UAV is able to avoid static and dynamic obstacles while still being able to recover its original trajectory after successful collision avoidance. Simulations for different mission scenarios show that this method is much more efficient at avoiding multiple obstacles than other methods. Algorithm effectiveness validation is provided with Monte Carlo simulations and parametric results. In addition, this algorithm does not have specific requirements on the sensor data types and can be applied to cooperative and non-cooperative intruders.},

  abstract={This Path Planning is one of the major problems in UAV which is yet to be explored to get an optimal path among two nodes (UAV). Though a huge amount of research proposals already endured related to path planning, still path planning problems persist keeping high mobility of UAVs. The usage and applications of UAV evolving rapidly in many areas. To solve the issues related to path planning, a certain optimal decision has to be taken for the various task done by UAV. All decision for path planning requires Navigation info. The motive behind path planning is not just a selection of the optimal path but also to get rid of collision during target operation. This is a very critical task to select the shortest path keeping in view that it should be collision-free to reach its final destination. UAVs have been used in civil applications as well. The main use of UAVs in civil applications is to search and rescue, surveillance, agriculture, monitoring, reconnaissance, etc. The path planning techniques are broadly divided into three brackets. i.e. Representative Techniques, Cooperative Techniques, and Non-Cooperative Techniques. These techniques provide a platform to analyze coverage in terms of area covered by UAVs and connectivity with neighboring UAVs. Path planning is the preliminary requirement of UAV for its autonomous function. In this article various challenges in path planning during target operation in an adversarial environment described in detailed manner.},

  abstract={The studies of Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) cooperative detection systems have received much attention due to their wide applications in the disaster rescue, target tracking, intelligent surveillance, and automatical package delivery missions. UAVs provide a broad view and have a fast speed in the air, while UGVs have sufficient load capacity and can serve as repeater stations on the ground. The path planning of a UAV/UGV cooperative system is an important but difficult issue, which aims to plan paths for both the UAVs and the UGVs in the system to cooperatively complete a mission. In this article, we consider the path planning problem of the UAV/UGV cooperative system for illegal urban building detection, by taking the limits of UGV speed, UAV load power, and UAV/UGV communication restriction into consideration. To solve this problem, we first model the path planning problem as a constraint optimization problem which tries to minimize an overall execution time for completing the illegal urban building detection tasks, and then propose a two-level memetic algorithm (called Two-MA) to solve the path planning problems of both the UAV and the UGV. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets show the superiority of the proposed Two-MA over several states-of-the-art algorithms in solving the path planning problems of the UAV and UGV for illegal urban building detection tasks. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the task of detecting illegal buildings in cities by unmanned vehicles. Previous works mainly focus on path planning of either UAVs or UGVs in this task. This article proposes a new approach using an Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) cooperative system for detecting illegal buildings in parks, by taking the limits of UGV speed, UAV load power, and UAV/UGV communication restriction into consideration. This cooperative system consists of a UAV, UGV, and control center. The UAV equipped with cameras takes aerial photography in the air, and can transmit collected photos to the control center. The UGV executes loading and transportation on the ground, and can serve as takeoff and landing platforms for the UAV. The control center executes computationally intensive tasks such as data transmission and processing, task scheduling, and vehicle coordination. To quickly complete all detection tasks, a memetic algorithm is proposed for path planning of both the UAV and the UGV. The simulated results show that the proposed algorithm enables the UAV/UGV cooperative system to visit all buildings in cities with a minimum task execution time.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning is an important preliminary step in UAV mission planning. Artificial potential field (APF) UAV path planning method is often employed to build an intuitive model which is updated by the additional forces pushing the trajectory away from threats of non-cooperative objects and toward the predefined target. However, APF has its own weaknesses, one of which is the local minima close to concave obstacles. To tackle situation mentioned above, we propose a novel additional force model based on virtual waypoints. This model provides additional forces for candidate planning points falling into local minimum area and help them escape from local minimum area. Once the candidate is trapped in minimum area, firstly we calculate measure factor according to the planning area containing current candidate and the target point, and thus determine position of the virtual waypoint. Then the virtual waypoint generates additional control force so that the candidate can run away from the local minimum area. Finally, the simulation results show that the method can solve the local minimum problem in planning space.},

The proposed method utilizes the SphereMap algorithm to assess the accessibility of the POIs and generate paths that account for obstacle distances, including collision avoidance maneuvers among UAVs.

  abstract={Due to its high mobility, low cost, easy deployment, scalability, and intelligent characteristics, UAV has been widely used in the military and civil fields. However, considering that the endurance of UAV itself is limited to a certain extent, and the terrain of the affected area is often complex, and there is a lot of information to be collected, Therefore, reasonable path planning is the key to improving the efficiency of UAV data collection. By analyzing the above background, it leads to the significance of UAV path planning in emergency scenarios. Then, starting from the path planning of a single UAV, the classic algorithms of path planning of a single UAV are investigated, and the basic ideas and algorithm flow are analyzed. Thirdly, given the characteristics of the need to improve the efficiency of information retrieval in emergency scenarios, it is analyzed that compared with a single UAV, multi-UAV has higher search efficiency, better system stability, and is easier to realize in practical application. Ant colony algorithm is used to realize the cooperative search of multiple UAVs. In this part, the modeling process, design idea, search principle, and other details of the algorithm are introduced in detail, and its advantages are analyzed. After that, the feasibility of the algorithm is verified by simulation, and the advantages compared with other algorithms are compared. Finally, the shortcomings of the current algorithm and prospects are analyzed, and ideas for improvement are proposed.},

  abstract={This paper presents a centralized receding discrete time horizon controller for use in cooperative high level unmanned air vehicle (UAV) motion planning during a search for land based targets over large ground regions with sensor occlusions. Due to the non-Markovian, dynamic, multimodal, and discontinuous objective function employed, the controller presented uses a stochastic optimizer in the form of either a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) or a comprehensive learning PSO (CLPSO) to calculate UAV routes. A hybrid maneuver automaton is applied to model vehicle dynamics and a Fisher information theory based model of discrete ground regions is used as an objective function. Finally, the non-Markovian process PSO (NMPPSO) algorithm is introduced to achieve better performance by customizing the PSO and its variants to decision processes with non-Markovian reward through the use of a suffix trie.},

  abstract={This paper presents a formal intent based Flight Management System (FMS) hardware and functional structure utilising multi-level autonomy modes. The novel advanced capabilities added to the UAV autopilots are envisioned to meet the requirements of the future flight operations of the UAVs integrated into national airspace. The proposed FMS structure integrates new functionalities such as a) formal intent based information exchange and collaborative tactical planning utilising air-to-air and air-to-ground data links and, b) decentralised immediate sense-and-avoid. The collaborative nominal operation mode enables the ground operator to build “shared intelligence” with the UAV through the intent sharing. In this mode, the intent sharing process benefits from the advantages of formal intent languages at different levels of abstraction and data-links. The air-to-ground data link allows the ground operator to update/modify/re-plan the flight intent (FI) of the UAV(s) in any phase of the operation according to evolving situations through ground station. The air-to-air intent sharing also continues between the surrounding aircraft through the aircraft intent (AI) (“machine-to-machine” level) communication which makes unmanned systems to be visible. The sense-and-avoid mode, the FMS recursively computes and observes the probabilities of potential immediate collisions with the other aircraft and terrain. Whenever the immediate response needs, the FMS executes the generated 3D avoidance maneuver. For technology demonstration purposes, an experimental FMS hardware has been deployed in a quadrotor UAV, and a ground operator station with GUI has been designed enabling envisioned operational experiments.},

  abstract={In recent times Unmanned Aerial Vehicle developed promptly and broadly used in many areas like reconstruction rescue and monitoring. In all the areas one important key challenge is path planning which tells UAVs that where to fly and how to find a path. The Multiple consideration is to be considered for an ideal path planning which includes path completeness, optimality. The execution of path planning becomes a challenging task in terms of trajectory generation and also require careful consideration. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning techniques have been extensively studied and involve two key stages. First, 3-D objects and obstacles (static and dynamic) are identified. Second, these objects and obstacles are mapped to plan an appropriate path. In the context of UAVs, we can explain path planning techniques in terms of roadmaps/Voronoi diagrams (a representation technique), or we can adopt an optimization approach using either cooperative or non-cooperative techniques. These two approaches, and the techniques used in each, are summarized in terms of the key factors that have been discussed in the context of UAVs. This paper, enables future studies to easily compare with existing and previous studies.},

  abstract={Collaboration between several Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can produce high-quality results in numerous missions, including surveillance, search and rescue, tracking or identification. Such a combination of collaborative UAVs is referred to as a swarm. These several platforms enhance the global system capabilities by supporting some form of resilience and by increasing the number and/or the variety of the embedded sensors. Furthermore, several UAVs organized in a swarm can (should the ground control station support this) be considered as a single entity from an operator point-of-view. We aim at using such swarms in complex and unknown environments, and in the long term, allow compact flights. Dynamic path planning computation for each UAV is a major task to perform their mission. To define this path planning, we have implemented a three-dimensional (3D) mobility model for swarms of UAVs using both the Artificial Potential Fields (APF) principle and a global path planning method. In our model, the collaboration between the platforms is made by sharing information about the detected obstacles. To provide a significant validation of our mobility model, we have simulated real-world environments and real-world sensors characteristics, using the OMNeT ++ network simulator.},

  abstract={A simple and reactive algorithm for drone pursuit and collision avoidance for non-cooperative agents, not requiring global path planning is proposed in this paper. The pursuit algorithm is based on the geometrical rule PN- Parallel Navigation, using the same principle to track the target and for evading obstacles. Besides, our strategy does not require separate modes for pursuit and collision avoidance, as common in numerous works. The algorithm is validated numerically when tracking a mobile target in a confined environment in the presence of dynamic objects. Results show the good performance of the algorithm and confirm that the collision route property can be used to avoid reactively un-predicted and dynamic objects.},

  abstract={Distributed sensing by cooperative drone swarms is crucial for several Smart City applications, such as traffic monitoring and disaster response. Using an indoor lab with inexpensive drones, a testbed supports complex and ambitious studies on these systems while maintaining low cost, rigor, and external validity. This paper introduces the Multi-drone Sensing Experimentation Testbed (M-SET), a novel platform designed to prototype, develop, test, and evaluate distributed sensing with swarm intelligence. M-SET addresses the limitations of existing testbeds that fail to emulate collisions, thus lacking realism in outdoor environments. By integrating a collision avoidance method based on a potential field algorithm, M-SET ensures collision-free navigation and sensing, further optimized via a multi-agent collective learning algorithm. Extensive evaluation demonstrates accurate energy consumption estimation and a low risk of collisions, providing a robust proof-of-concept. New insights show that M-SET has significant potential to support ambitious research with minimal cost, simplicity, and high sensing quality.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV path planning strategy for fixed wing UAVs to provide convoy protection to a ground vehicle moving over a hilly terrain. As the ground target motion is in 3D, we have developed a Model-Predictive control based framework for tracking the convoy taking the terrain restriction, kinematic constraints of the UAV and the camera field-of-view into account. Due to these constraints, it may not be possible for a single UAV to track the convoy continuously and hence we develop a cooperative multi-UAV framework with two UAVs to ensure continuous tracking. The simulation results show that the proposed framework adequately tracks the target without losing the line-of-sight of the convoy.},

  abstract={Aiming at the fault tolerant control problem of quadrotor UAV, a distributed fault tolerant control method of multi-UAV is proposed. In distributed fault-tolerant control system, each UAV system contains a layered controller divided into two layers. The upper layer is a virtual system, which deals with the issues of track planning, formation control and cooperative communication among multiple UAVs. The lower layer is a real system, which deals with the track tracking and fault tolerance of a single UAV system. The complex multi-UAV group collaboration problem is decoupled into the fault tolerance problem of a single UAV. In the virtual system, the flight path planning and formation control algorithm plan the formation path and formation of UAV, and give the ideal state of each UAV. The real system of the lower layer tracks the ideal state of the UAV through the track tracking algorithm. When a UAV in the formation fails to track the ideal state, the uav will quit the formation. Since the real UAV system only receives the status information from the virtual system and does not transmit the information to the virtual system, the fault information is avoided to spread in the formation.},

  abstract={The rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technologies over the recent years has been decisive for their integration in emergency response missions. While initial use by first responders focused on manual operations, the need to improve utilization necessitates higher levels of automation.Contributing towards that end-goal, this work derives swarm path planning algorithms that can effectively and efficiently be employed to search and monitor the operating field. A swarm is composed by two or more units, that coordinate to achieve the mission objectives including minimizing search time while ensuring coverage of the field. A graph theoretic approach is followed to model the underlying swarm path planning problem and mathematical programming is employed to describe a number of important variants of the cooperative strategies that arise. Thereafter, 4 algorithms are derived to solve the swarm path planning problem that are computationally efficient to implement and use in practice. A thorough performance evaluation is conducted to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each heuristic using a number of key performance metrics.},

  abstract={This paper presents a methodology for coordinated standoff tracking of moving target groups using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The vector field guidance approach for a single UAV is first applied to track a group of targets by defining a variable standoff orbit to be followed, which can keep all targets within the field-of-view of the UAV. A new feedforward term is included in the guidance command considering variable standoff distance, and the convergence of the vector field to the standoff orbit is analyzed and enhanced by adjusting radial velocity using two active measures associated with vector field generation. Moreover, for multiple group tracking by multiple UAVs, a two-phase approach is proposed as a suboptimal solution for a Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem, consisting of target clustering/assignment and cooperative standoff group tracking with online local replanning. Lastly, localization sensitivity to the group of targets is investigated for different angular separations between UAVs and sensing configurations. Numerical simulations are performed using randomly moving ground vehicles with multiple UAVs to verify the feasibility and benefit of the proposed approach.},

First, with models of separated regions and heterogeneous UAVs, the objective function and flight constraints are analyzed to fully search the best solutions for the path planning problem. Then, considering a dense target group model, a path planning method based on an Improved Ant Colony System algorithm (IACS) is proposed. The IACS algorithm is able to achieve an efficiency enhancement in time consumption on targets detection and minimize the total time of UAV mission execution by adopting a novel target exploring scheme called BI-directional simplified search strategy in the target selection process. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation experiments with randomly generated targets.},

  abstract={This paper studies a novel wireless information surveillance scenario, where the legitimate party aims to eavesdrop on multiple suspicious communication links with the help of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Each suspicious link is comprised of a UAV (transmitter) and its fixed destination. To improve the eavesdropping ability, cooperative legitimate UAVs emit jamming signals to reduce the capacities of suspicious channels and plan the flight trajectory to enhance the capacity of the eavesdropping channels. Considering the system dynamics, it is natural to model this sequential decision-making problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which might be solved by reinforcement learning (RL). However, it is difficult to design a policy in RL that determines jamming powers satisfying the considered eavesdropping constraints. Therefore, we decompose the optimization process into two phases, 1) obtaining the non-learning-based optimal solver for jamming power allocation under each state, and 2) optimizing the policy of moving action by RL. We will show this decoupled optimization process also holds the optimality. Considering the flying safety, we will determine the individual moving policy for each legitimate UAV rather than a centralized policy that controls all UAVs. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

  abstract={This study uses a Bezier curve-based shaping (BCBS) approach based on the dynamic model to quickly generate 3D cooperative trajectories for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It can facilitate the solution of the flight trajectory problem that occurs after the reallocation of mission points. Trajectory coordinates are expanded based on the Bezier curves that naturally satisfy boundary conditions (BCs); trajectories with the minimum flight time and those satisfying the dynamic constraints and collision-free conditions can be obtained by adjusting the Bezier coefficients. A three-UAV flight simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further, the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM). The simulation results of the BCBS method are used as the initial values for GPM optimization. It is demonstrated that the BCBS method requires a lower computation time than the direct solver, which is only 0.07% of the latter, and obtains similar optimization results (3.34% difference). This is considerably important for the rapid generation of optimized trajectories with the limited computing power of onboard computers. Furthermore, this method is expected to achieve online collaborative trajectory generation for multiple UAVs in view of its high computational efficiency.},

  abstract={A set of modeling method and optimization model for multi-UAV cooperative target searching at sea is proposed. First, a basic model is built according to the maneuvering rules of ships and drones. Then, on the basis of considering the load balance of each UAV, the historical discovery probability of sea area is used to update the target probability map information. Finally, the ant colony algorithm is used to optimize the search route of each UAV, considering both the energy supply demand of UAV and the maximum target discovery probability. The simulation results show that the proposed method has high search efficiency and can be effectively applied to the fast search task of Marine targets, which has important application value.},

  abstract={In three dimensional environments feasible paths for UAVs should be smooth, flyable and safe. To solve the problem of multi-UAVs cooperative path planning with kinds of constraints, a multi-objective optimization approach based on differential evolution is proposed, which uses a group of UAV paths as evolution individuals. In this paper, we adopt a novel combined strategy to enhance the efficiency of difference. To fit UAV constraints and cooperative constraints, a cooperative fitness function is given to measure the pare to optimal solution. And then the control vertexes of a B-spline curve are calculated reversely to get a group of flyable smoothing paths for UAVs. The simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively improves the cooperative accuracy and works well in smoothing paths for UAVs.},

  abstract={Oil spill incidents in the sea or harbors occur with some regularity during exploration, production, and transport of petroleum products. In order to mitigate the impact of the oil spill in the marine life, immediate, safety, effective and eco-friendly actions must be taken. Autonomous vehicles can assume an important contribution by establishing a cooperative and coordinated intervention. This paper presents the development of a path planning control-law methods for an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) being able to contour the oil spill while is deploying microorganisms and nutrients (bioremediation) capable of mitigating and contain the oil spill spread with the collaboration of a UAV vehicle. An oil spill simulation scenario was developed in Gazebo to support the evaluation of the cooperative actions between the ASV and UAV and to infer the ASV path planning for each one of the proposed control-law methods.},

  abstract={The application of air-ground collaborative network has become increasingly widespread in intelligent vehicular systems. In order to effectively utilize multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide fast services and improve resource allocation for air-ground vehicular network, this paper proposes a 3D terrain-oriented path planning algorithm for multi-UAVs assisted intelligent vehicular network based on swarm intelligence optimization. It is aimed to address UAVs' air-ground path planning in complex 3D terrains, requiring substantial computation. However, the current multi-objective bald eagle search algorithm tends to approach the center point, resulting in low accuracy when solving such problems. Firstly, the 3D terrain environment model, threat source model, and other models were constructed, and the multi-objective cost function was determined. Secondly, a coupled chaotic map initialization was designed to effectively improve the quality of the initialized population. In addition, an adaptive Gaussian walk strategy based on the “reconnaissance eagle” was designed to balance development and search capabilities. The fast non-dominated sorting was introduced to further improve the algorithmic efficiency. Finally, we utilized the correlation between the position of the bald eagle and UAV flight parameters of speed, turning angle, and climbing angle. An improved multi-objective bald eagle search (IMBES) was designed to efficiently search for UAV configuration space and find the optimal Pareto front. The experimental results show that the designed IMBES algorithm has a success rate of 70.50%. This proposed method offers improved optimization ability, smoother paths, and reduced energy consumption for optimizing collaborative terrain-oriented air-ground path planning, compared with existing path planning methods.},

  abstract={Robots are increasingly being used in situations such as search and rescue that require robust navigation capabilities, potentially in areas with little or no GPS or other high-quality localization information. As more robots are used in these scenarios, it becomes viable to collaborate between heterogeneous types of robots to leverage their individual strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. More specifically, in a scenario involving unmanned ground and aerial vehicles (UGV, UAV), the ground robot can contribute its high payload capacity to provide computational resources and high accuracy sensors while the aerial robot can bring its high mobility and capability to traverse obstacles to the team. However, in order for the team to benefit from these capabilities, it must be capable of generating a plan for both robots that allows them to collaboratively localize when necessary. Our approach to this problem is to combine a recently developed state lattice planner using controller-based motion primitives (SLC) with planning using adaptive dimensionality (PAD). The SLC planner allows for robust navigation using a wide variety of sensors including in areas with no or limited high-quality localization information while the PAD planner allows us to expand beyond a single robot and generate plans for a team of robots operating in a high dimensional space. We present our results to this combined approach for a UGV/UAV team operating indoors in areas with limited visual features.},

  abstract={As the need for autonomous reconnaissance and surveillance missions in cluttered urban environments has been increasing, this paper describes a cooperative path planning algorithm for tracking a moving target in urban environments using both unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The novelty of the algorithm is that it takes into account vision occlusions due to obstacles in the environment. The algorithm uses a dynamic occupancy grid to model the target state, which is updated by sensor measurements using a Bayesian filter. Based on the current and predicted target behavior, the path planning algorithm for a single vehicle (UAV/UGV) is first designed to maximize the sum of the probability of detection over a finite look-ahead horizon. The algorithm is then extended to multiple vehicle collaboration scenarios, where a decentralized planning algorithm relying on an auction scheme is designed to plan finite look-ahead paths that maximize the sum of the joint probability of detection over all vehicles.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the multi-task allocation problem with complex constraints in the multi-UAV system by presenting an extension to consensus-based bundle algorithm(CBBA). The presented algorithm termed dynamic clustering consensus-based bundle algorithm(DCCBBA) provides an improved bundle construction, a novel consensus strategy and a systematic way of grouping. DCCBBA features different consensus methods for inner conflict resolution and outer conflict resolution. The inner conflict resolution aims at handling the violated task assignment that belongs to the same cluster, while outer conflict resolution guarantees conflict-free assignments in the overall UAVs. The proposed DCCBBA coupled with Pythagorean Hodograph curves can significantly reduce the number of communication events required to achieve consensus while preserving the robust convergence property of the baseline CBBA. Numerical simulations on various cooperative reconnaissance and strike tasks demonstrate the reduction of communication events compared with the baseline CBBA, the cluster-formed CBBA, the grouped CBBA and Two-layer CBBA.},

  abstract={Motivated by cooperative exploration missions, this paper considers constant velocity, level flight path planning for Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with range limited, omni-directional sensors. These active energy-based sensors collect information about objects of interest at rates that depend on the range to the objects according to Shannon's channel capacity equation, where the signal-to-noise ratio is governed by the radar equation. The mission of the UAVs is to travel through a given area and collect a specified amount of information about each object of interest while minimizing the total mission time. This information can then be used to classify the objects of interest. An optimal path planning problem is formulated where the states are the Cartesian coordinates of the UAVs and the amounts of information collected about each object of interest, the control inputs are the UAV heading angles, the objective function is the total mission time, and the boundary conditions are subject to inequality constraints that reflect the requirements of information collection. Necessary conditions for optimality are given, whose solutions yield extremal paths, and whose utilization highlights analytical properties of these extremal paths. The problem exhibits several limiting regimes, including the so-called Watchtower and the Multi-Vehicle Traveling Salesman Problem. These results are illustrated on several time-optimal cooperative exploration scenarios.},

  abstract={Existing methods based on statistical models ignore the detail effect of the real environment on path loss, leading to some discrepancies with the actual results in real urban environments. In order to reduce the discrepancies and improve the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) coverage effect, a multi-UAV coverage method based on deterministic radio wave propagation is proposed. First, the ray-tracing method, as one of the deterministic models, is used to simulate the path loss. Next, the cooperative search and coverage problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles is modeled as a potential game model, and the utility function is designed by path loss. After that action set is designed to constrain the motion of unmanned aerial vehicles. Then, the coverage problem is solved using a binary log-linear learning algorithm, which combines ray-tracing method and deterministic model. Finally, experiments are conducted in local areas of two cities, Haikou and Guangzhou by proposed method and statistic models. The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of multi-UAV cooperative search and coverage tasks in urban areas and can achieve better performance than the statistical model-based methods.},

  abstract={The use of aerial swarms to solve real-world problems has been increasing steadily, accompanied by falling prices and improving performance of communication, sensing, and processing hardware. The commoditization of hardware has reduced unit costs, thereby lowering the barriers to entry to the field of aerial swarm robotics. A key enabling technology for swarms is the family of algorithms that allow the individual members of the swarm to communicate and allocate tasks amongst themselves, plan their trajectories, and coordinate their flight in such a way that the overall objectives of the swarm are achieved efficiently. These algorithms, often organized in a hierarchical fashion, endow the swarm with autonomy at every level, and the role of a human operator can be reduced, in principle, to interactions at a higher level without direct intervention. This technology depends on the clever and innovative application of theoretical tools from control and estimation. This paper reviews the state of the art of these theoretical tools, specifically focusing on how they have been developed for, and applied to, aerial swarms. Aerial swarms differ from swarms of ground-based vehicles in two respects: they operate in a three-dimensional space and the dynamics of individual vehicles adds an extra layer of complexity. We review dynamic modeling and conditions for stability and controllability that are essential in order to achieve cooperative flight and distributed sensing. The main sections of this paper focus on major results covering trajectory generation, task allocation, adversarial control, distributed sensing, monitoring, and mapping. Wherever possible, we indicate how the physics and subsystem technologies of aerial robots are brought to bear on these individual areas.},

The system encompasses task generation and allocation, flight path generation and tracking, and synchronization between cooperative tasks. Task allocation is posed as a constraint satisfaction problem. The design of two classes of orbital flight paths, lateral and longitudinal, is discussed.

  abstract={We consider the problem of optimal cooperative three-dimensional conflict resolution involving multiple unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) using numerical trajectory optimization methods. The conflict problem is posed as an optimal control problem of finding trajectories that minimize a certain objective function while maintaining the safe separation between each UAV pair. We assume the origin and destination of the UAV are known and consider UAV models with simplified linear kinematics. The main objective of this report is to present two different approaches to the solution of the problem. In the first approach, the optimal control is converted to a finite dimensional nonlinear program (NLP) by using collocation on finite elements and by reformulating the disjunctions involved in modeling the protected zones by using continuous variables. In the second approach the optimal control is converted to a finite dimensional mixed integer linear program (MILP) using Euler discretization and reformulating the disjunctions involved with the protected zones by using binary variables and Big-M techniques. Based on results of extensive random simulations, we compare time complexity and optimality of the solutions obtained with the MILP approach and the NLP approach. NLPs are essential to enforce flyability constraints on more detailed UAV models. Moreover, any nonlinear extensions to the problem cannot be dealt with by MILP solvers. The main objective of this paper is to open the route to the use of MILP solutions (based on simple linear UAV models) in order to initialize NLP solvers which allow the use of dynamic UAV models at any desired level of detail},

  abstract={Recent years have witnessed increasingly more Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications for data collection in the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to the limited energy and service capacity, it is very challenging for a single UAV to accomplish the data collection while guaranteeing the information freshness of IoT devices or sensor nodes (SNs). In practice, different types of UAVs may have different energy capabilities. In this paper, we propose a more practical heterogeneous UAV swarm path planning problem for optimizing the information freshness, in which the division and cooperation among UAVs with different energy capacities have been taken into consideration. The freshness, i.e., age of information (AoI) collected from each SN is characterized by the data uploading time and the time elapsed since the UAV leaves this SN. We successfully present a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on attention mechanism by end-to-end training to optimize the average age under UAVs’ energy constraints. The simulation results show that our algorithm has fast convergence, high optimization capability and reliability, and can solve the heterogeneous UAV swarm cooperative AoI optimization problem effectively.},

  abstract={Most of the recent results in control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have focused on motion stability and navigation in well-structured environments, without considering communication delay influences. In order to deal with time delays and packet losses in networked UAVs, this paper suggests a machine learning based Gaussian process (GP) filter for a path planning problem. The developed GP filter estimates the UAV states accurately given delayed observation by learning the pattern of network-induced effects on UAV maneuvers. We validate that the GP filter produces the lower error rate than Kalman filter by analyzing error covariances. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a collaborative trajectory tracking task for two networked-UAVs and the better control performance is achieved.},

  abstract={An algorithm for autonomous bird deterring using teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is being proposed in this paper. Birds cause significant damage to commercial crops globally. A bird deterring system using autonomous UAVs can potentially overcome the limitations of current bird management methods. The problem of controlling UAVs to deter birds is formulated as a model predictive control problem. Occupancy gird map is used to construct a world model which represents the system’s knowledge of the current location of target birds. A bird behaviour model and a sensor model are derived based on experimental results from a series of field trials. The future state of the target is estimated by propagating the centralised world model in time. Cooperative deterring missions are planned autonomously by optimising cost functions assigned to each UAV. A series of simulated scenarios are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system at driving UAVs to protect an 8 hectare area from multiple bird flocks. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by cooperating a team of two UAVs, the same bird deterring mission can be completed more efficiently compared to using a single UAV.},

  abstract={UAV has been a popular piece of equipment both in military and civilian applications. Groups of UAVs can form an UAV network and accomplish complicated missions such as rescue, searching, patrolling and mapping. One of the most active areas of research in UAV networks is that of area coverage problem which is usually defined as a problem of how well the UAV networks are able to monitor the given space, and how well the UAVs inside a network are able to cooperate with each other. Area coverage problem in cooperative UAV networks is the very base of many applications. In this paper, we take a representative survey of the current work that has been done about this problem via discussion of different classifications. This study serves as an overview of area coverage problem, and give some inspiration to related researchers.},
